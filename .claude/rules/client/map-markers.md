# Map markers (MapView hex-icon stack UX)

Co-located hex markers no longer overlap at the hex center. Markers split into two
classes by their source array (not a predicate): **PRIMARY** = player bands, drawn by
`MapView._draw_primary_bands` over the `units`/`populations` array; **SECONDARY** = herds /
food sites / wondrous sites, placed by `MapView._compute_secondary_slots`. (Tuning consts
are grouped near the top of `MapView.gd`, after the FoW/height consts.)

- **PRIMARY — player bands** own the **center spotlight** as an offset card-stack
  (`_draw_primary_bands`/`_draw_band_stack`/`_draw_band_token`). Each band's token is its
  **settlement stage**, which the sim resolves from `settlement_stage_config.json`: the **bundled
  sprite** for its `settlement_stage_id` where we have art (`StageSprites` — see its row above; the
  sprite is tried BEFORE the empty-glyph placeholder branch, which returns early), else the opaque
  `settlement_stage_icon` emoji (⛺ nomadic / 🛖 camp / 🏘️ village). Either way at
  `BAND_STAGE_GLYPH_SIZE_FACTOR` via the shared drop-shadow helpers (`_draw_marker_sprite` /
  `_draw_marker_glyph`), **no faction ring or disc**. Ownership is carried by a **faction-colored nameplate banner** (`_draw_band_banner`,
  `BAND_BANNER_*` consts) — a short rounded bar under the token filled with the band's faction
  color, drawn for the **active (primary) card only** and LOD-suppressed below
  `ICON_MIN_DETAIL_RADIUS`. The banner is intentionally sized as the substrate for an optional
  faction/band **name label** later (text on the bar). When `settlement_stage_icon` is empty
  (pre-stage / missing snapshot — rare) the token draws a small **neutral non-circular** fallback
  marker (gray square, `BAND_FALLBACK_MARKER_*`) instead of the glyph, never a disc. The stage
  label (`settlement_stage_label`) surfaces as the Occupants roster row's hover tooltip.
  Multiple bands on one hex fan up-right: up to `BAND_STACK_MAX_CARDS` (3) cards,
  back cards **darkened** (glyph multiplied by `BAND_STACK_BEHIND_TINT` so they recede/shadow),
  the **active** band (the one whose `entity == selected_unit_id`, else the first) drawn
  full-brightness on top. The active band reads by brightness alone — there is **no per-token
  selection ring** (the hex selection outline marks the tile); `BAND_STACK_BEHIND_TINT` is the
  single lever for the recede effect (RGB<1 darkens, alpha<1 fades — swap between the two there).
  Beyond 3, a `×N` count pill folded onto the **right end of the banner** (nameplate-with-count).
  Food-days dot + the travel arrow draw on the active card only.
- **SECONDARY — herds / food sites / wondrous sites** ring the hex in **fixed edge slots**
  (`SECONDARY_SLOT_OFFSETS`, near the hex corners), computed once per frame in
  `_compute_secondary_slots` by category priority **wonder → food → herd** (sequential fill,
  so icons never jump frame-to-frame). Cap `SECONDARY_VISIBLE_CAP` (3) visible icons; extras
  collapse into a `+N` overflow chip (`_draw_secondary_overflow`). Glyphs drop the old dark
  backing disc for a 1px drop shadow (`_draw_marker_glyph`). Herd migration arrow is thinner
  and only drawn on the hovered/selected herd tile. The `×N`/`+N` pills share `_draw_count_pill`.
- **Selected + hovered hex outline** (`_draw_tile_selection_highlight`, reusing `_outline_hex`):
  a solid white hex outline on `selected_tile`, a faint one on `_hovered_tile` (skipped when
  hover == selection) — this replaces the old selection-as-marker-ring feel.
- **Select-then-cycle** (`handle_hex_click` + `cycle_index`): re-clicking the current
  `selected_tile` with >1 band advances `cycle_index` (mod band count) so the stack surfaces the
  next band on top; a fresh tile resets to the top band. `select_occupant` (roster click) syncs
  `cycle_index` to the picked band's stack position via `_cycle_index_for_unit`.
- **Zoom LOD**: below `ICON_MIN_DETAIL_RADIUS` (far zoom, tiny hexes) secondary icons + all
  count/overflow chips are suppressed; only primary tokens draw.
