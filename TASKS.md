# Prototype Task List

## Core Simulation (`core_sim`)
- [x] Flesh out deterministic ECS systems (materials, logistics, population).
- [x] Replace placeholder system with staged schedules and fixed-point math.
- [x] Add snapshot/delta serialization hooks feeding `sim_schema` schemas.
- [x] Draft power phase architecture updates that align `run_turn`'s power stage with `shadow_scale_strategy_game_concept_technical_plan_v_0.md` §4, enumerate required energy subsystems (generation forms, instability handling, grid state), and spill follow-on implementation tickets once documented (Owner: TBD, Estimate: 1.5d; Deps: review existing materials/logistics schedules). _Status_: Plan captured in `docs/architecture.md` §Power Systems Plan and synced with manual §4 Power Simulation Pillars.
- [x] Capture knowledge ledger/leak mechanic design in `docs/architecture.md` per manual §5a—cover timers, espionage modifiers, UI data feeds—and produce downstream tasks for backend and Godot wiring (Owner: TBD, Estimate: 1.5d; Deps: Great Discovery architecture outline). _Status_: Architecture captured in `docs/architecture.md` §Knowledge Ledger & Leak Mechanics with manual §5a alignment; telemetry/command integrations enumerated and follow-on tickets below._
- [x] Stand up `KnowledgeLedger` infrastructure in `core_sim` (resource representations, stage registration, baseline leak math) according to `docs/architecture.md` §Knowledge Ledger & Leak Mechanics (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 2d; Deps: trade diffusion plumbing, Great Discovery hooks). _Status_: Stage registration now runs the full leak math pipeline, espionage plumbing feeds infiltrations/countermeasures, and telemetry/snapshot surfaces are live (`core_sim/src/knowledge_ledger.rs`, `core_sim/src/lib.rs`, `core_sim/src/snapshot.rs`)._
  - [x] Implement leak modifier aggregation + half-life recomputation inside `knowledge_ledger_tick` following architecture table values. _Status_: Tick loop now folds modifier, countermeasure, and infiltration pressure into effective half-life and progress deltas (`core_sim/src/knowledge_ledger.rs`)._
  - [x] Persist espionage probes/counter-intel events into the ledger (requires upcoming espionage plumbing). _Status_: Mission resolution emits probe/sweep events and `process_espionage_events` records infiltrations plus countermeasures each turn (`core_sim/src/espionage.rs`, `core_sim/src/knowledge_ledger.rs`)._
  - [x] Build espionage agent & mission scheduling systems that emit `EspionageProbeEvent` / `CounterIntelSweepEvent` (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 3d; Deps: ledger scaffolding, agent roster design). _Status_: `core_sim/src/espionage.rs` now loads data-driven agent/mission catalogs, queues missions via `EspionageMissionState::queue_mission`, resolves them before `process_espionage_events`, and is covered by `core_sim/src/espionage.rs` unit tests; mission metadata lives in `core_sim/src/data/espionage_{agents,missions}.json`._
- [x] Implement counter-intelligence mission scheduling & defensive sweeps (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 2d; Deps: espionage mission system). _Status_: `core_sim/src/espionage.rs` now auto-schedules defensive sweeps via `schedule_counter_intel_missions`, integrates with mission resolution/tests, and runs each turn before `process_espionage_events`; telemetry-ready sweeps clear infiltrations and register countermeasures._
  - [x] Introduce counter-intel budget & policy hooks controlling defensive auto-scheduling (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 1.5d; Deps: counter-intel scheduling, design docs updated). _Status_: `CounterIntelBudgets` and `FactionSecurityPolicies` now gate `schedule_counter_intel_missions`; sweeps spend/regen per `core_sim/src/data/espionage_config.json`, log budget shortfalls, and record usage via `SimulationMetrics::knowledge_counterintel_budget_spent` with coverage in `core_sim/src/espionage.rs` tests._

(Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 1d; Deps: mission generator output.) _Status_: `knowledge_ledger_tick` now emits `missions` alongside telemetry frames, powered by `KnowledgeTelemetryMission`, so client tooling can enumerate generated templates each turn._
  - [x] Allow runtime toggling of agent generators (`enabled` / `per_faction`) via hot-reload or command surface for mid-campaign adjustments. (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 1d; Deps: generator catalog config.) _Status_: New `update_espionage_generators` command adjusts generator flags in `EspionageCatalog`; the roster reseeds generated agents immediately so changes land mid-campaign._
  - [x] Surface `EspionageMissionState::queue_mission` on the command server for client scheduling. (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 1.5d; Deps: command routing.) _Status_: `queue_espionage_mission` command now maps to `QueueMissionParams`, invoking `EspionageMissionState::queue_mission` with catalog/roster resources so clients can schedule missions mid-turn._
  - [x] Expand mission outcomes (partial successes, misinformation branches) and counter-intel sweeps that actively clear infiltrations. (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 2d; Deps: mission outcome framework.) _Status_: Probe resolution now supports partial success/misinformation tiers via `espionage_config`, and successful counter-intel sweeps clear infiltration records while applying suspicion relief._
  - [x] Support hot-reloading/command tweaks for `QueueMissionParams` defaults via the espionage config pipeline. (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 1d; Deps: balance config scaffolding.) _Status_: `espionage_config.json` now carries queue defaults, `queue_espionage_mission` consumes them automatically, and the new `update_espionage_queue_defaults` command lets operators adjust offsets/tiers at runtime._
- [x] Implement leak progression, espionage/counter-intel event handling, and metrics export in `knowledge_ledger_tick`, finishing snapshot serialization into the new schema tables (Owner: Systems Team — Ravi, Estimate: 1.5d; Deps: KnowledgeLedger infrastructure task). _Status_: Leak progression math, countermeasure decay, event ingestion, metrics export, and snapshot serialization are live across `core_sim/src/knowledge_ledger.rs` and related plumbing._

- [x] Deliver `tools/script_harness` headless runner with mock feeds, fuzz hooks, and CI budget assertions for sandbox violations (Owner: Omar, Estimate: 2d; Deps: capability registry & host bindings). _Status_: Harness builds against the native runtime and exposes tick/event CLI hooks; next step is adding scripted smoke tests.
- [x] Implement save/load serialization for active scripts and `storage.session` payloads via new `SimScriptState` struct and add regression coverage (Owner: Devi, Estimate: 1.5d; Deps: `sim_runtime` capability registry). _Status_: `SimScriptState`/`ScriptManifestRef` capture enabled script metadata; Godot host exposes `capture_state`/`restore_state`, and runtime applies session + subscription restores with validation.
- [x] Formalize the scripting manifest contract: publish JSON schema, add lint/validation tooling against `CapabilitySpec`, document host runtime checks, and sync manual/architecture references (Owner: TBD, Estimate: 2d; Deps: capability registry finalized). _Status_: Schema emitted to `docs/scripting_manifest.schema.json`, `cargo xtask validate-manifests` enforces shape + capability coverage, and docs/manual sections reference the contract + runtime checks.

## Tooling & Tests
- [x] Add determinism regression test comparing dual runs.
- [x] Introduce benchmark harness for 10k/50k/100k entities.
- [x] Integrate tracing/tracing-subscriber metrics dump accessible via CLI.
- [x] Add regression coverage ensuring `TerrainOverlayState` updates propagate on biome/tag changes (Owner: TBD, Estimate: 1d; Deps: finalized terrain legend work). _Status_: Exercised by `snapshot::tests::terrain_overlay_delta_updates_on_biome_change` covering biome/tag mutation delta emission.

## Core Simulation Roadmap
- [x] Implement per-faction order submission and turn resolution phases (Owner: Sam, Estimate: 4d).
- [x] Persist snapshot history for replays and rollbacks (Owner: Devi, Estimate: 3d).
- [x] Define `CommandEnvelope` protobuf schema and expose encode/decode helpers in `sim_runtime` (Owner: Leo, Estimate: 0.5d; Deps: docs updated for protobuf migration).
- [x] Add dual-stack command server (Protobuf + legacy text) and update Godot/QuickJS host wrappers to issue structured commands (Owner: Leo, Estimate: 1.0d; Deps: `CommandEnvelope` helpers).
- [x] Retire legacy text parser, cut a migration guide for clients, and enable protobuf-only mode once tooling validates (Owner: Leo, Estimate: 0.5d; Deps: dual-stack validation).

## Documentation
- [x] Document workflow and architecture decisions in `/docs`.
- [x] Capture integration guide for frontend clients (API schema draft).
- [x] Write developer ergonomics survey template for week 2 milestone.
