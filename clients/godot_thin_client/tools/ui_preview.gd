## Dev-only UI preview harness.

## Instances the real HudLayer with canned selection data, renders each state,
## and saves a PNG to `ui_preview_out/` in the project. Lets us iterate on HUD /
## selection-panel / targeting styling without a running server or manual
## screenshots. Not part of the game — run explicitly:
##
##   godot --path . res://tools/ui_preview.tscn
