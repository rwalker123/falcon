# Godot Thin Client

Inspector and visualization client for the Shadow-Scale simulation. Renders the map, streams snapshots, and exposes the tabbed inspector.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Build native extension
cargo xtask godot-build

# Build terrain texture atlas (if out of date)
scripts/build_terrain_textures.sh

# Run client (auto-builds textures if needed)
scripts/run_stack.sh --client-only

# Regenerate FlatBuffers bindings
cargo build -p shadow_scale_flatbuffers && cargo xtask godot-build
```

**Sockets**:
- Snapshot stream: `127.0.0.1:41002` (FlatBuffers via `SimulationConfig::snapshot_flat_bind`)
- Command socket: `127.0.0.1:41001` (Protobuf `CommandEnvelope`)
- Log stream: `127.0.0.1:41003` (length-prefixed JSON tracing frames)

## Architecture

### Scene Structure
- `Main.tscn` - Root `Node2D` scene with a `Camera2D`, the `MapView` map layer, and `CanvasLayer`s for HUD/inspector
- The client is **2D-only**; an experimental 3D relief view was permanently removed (see `docs/architecture.md` → "Removed: 3D Relief Rendering")
- Toggle: `I` hides/shows inspector, `L` collapses legend

### Data Flow
```
Server (FlatBuffers) -> SnapshotStream.gd -> parsed snapshot
                                          -> MapView (terrain/overlays)
                                          -> Inspector (panels)
                                          -> Hud (legend, selection)
```

### Native Extension
`native/` contains GDExtension bindings for FlatBuffers decoding (generated from `sim_schema/schemas/snapshot.fbs`).

> **Note:** Elevation is not rendered as 3D relief. A shallow-3D heightfield view was
> prototyped and permanently removed; elevation is now surfaced only as the 2D **Elevation
> Heatmap** overlay. The `ElevationOverlay.samples` raster still streams from the core for that
> heatmap and for gameplay, but the per-vertex `normals` field (3D-only) was dropped from the
> schema. See `docs/architecture.md` → "Removed: 3D Relief Rendering".

## Minimap System

The map view displays a minimap in the bottom-right corner showing the full map with a viewport indicator rectangle.

### Component (`ui/MinimapPanel.gd`)
Reusable minimap UI component handling:
- CanvasLayer hierarchy setup (layer 102)
- Aspect ratio sizing from grid dimensions
- Click-to-pan with drag support
- Viewport indicator overlay with draw callbacks

### 2D Minimap (MapView.gd)
- Renders terrain at 1 pixel per hex as an `ImageTexture`
- Viewport indicator uses pointy-top hex coordinate math:
  - Screen corners → axial coords (q,r) → offset coords (col,row) → normalized [0,1]
- Click-to-pan converts normalized position → hex grid coords → pan_offset

### Configuration
Minimap sizing parameters live in `heightfield_config.json` (the file also holds fog-of-war appearance tunables; its 3D-relief sections were removed):
```json
"minimap": {
  "base_height": 220,
  "min_width": 140.0,
  "max_width": 520.0,
  "margin": 16.0
}
```

## Terrain Texture System

Optional terrain texture graphics for the 2D map view.

### Asset Structure
```
assets/terrain/
  textures/
    base/                        # 37 terrain textures (512x512 PNG)
      00_deep_ocean.png
      ...
      36_aquifer_ceiling.png
    edges/                       # 6 edge masks for blending (optional)
    wang/                        # Wang tile variants (future)
  terrain_config.json            # Configuration
  TerrainTextureManager.gd       # Autoload singleton for centralized texture loading
  TerrainDefinitions.gd          # Single source of truth for terrain definitions
  TerrainTextureGenerator.gd     # CLI script to generate placeholder textures
```

### Enabling Terrain Textures
1. Generate placeholder textures from command line:
   ```bash
   godot --headless --path clients/godot_thin_client --script assets/terrain/TerrainTextureGenerator.gd
   ```
2. Replace placeholders in `assets/terrain/textures/base/` with AI-generated or hand-crafted textures
3. Set `"use_terrain_textures": true` in `terrain_config.json`

Textures are loaded at runtime from individual PNGs and combined into a `Texture2DArray`.

### Configuration (`terrain_config.json`)
```json
{
  "use_terrain_textures": true,
  "use_edge_blending": true,
  "texture_scale": 4.0,
  "blend_width": 0.15,
  "lod_near_distance": 50.0,
  "lod_far_distance": 200.0
}
```

### Texture Loading (TerrainTextureManager)
- Autoload singleton loads textures once at startup for the 2D map renderer
- Builds `Texture2DArray` from individual PNGs in `textures/base/`
- Exposes: `terrain_textures` (Texture2DArray), `terrain_config`, `use_terrain_textures`, `use_edge_blending`

### 2D Rendering Pipeline
- `MapView` gets textures from `TerrainTextureManager` and pre-renders hex-masked textures on startup
- Cached as `ImageTexture` per terrain ID for efficient drawing
- Falls back to solid colors when overlay mode is active
- Textures only displayed in base view (empty overlay key)
- Edge blending: gradient lines drawn at terrain boundaries

### Edge Blending - Overlay/Fringe Technique
When `use_edge_blending` is enabled, the 2D renderer uses a standard overlay/fringe technique:
- 6 edge gradient masks (`assets/terrain/textures/edges/edge_mask_*.png`)
- 222 pre-rendered edge overlays (37 terrains × 6 edges)
- Neighbor terrain texture fades in at hex boundaries

Generate edge masks: `godot --headless --script assets/terrain/EdgeMaskGenerator.gd`

## Inspector Panels

See `docs/godot_inspector_plan.md` for full roadmap.

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Map | Overlay selector, logistics toggle, map size dropdown, Generate Map button |
| Terrain | Biome list, tag histograms, tile drill-down |
| Fauna | Herd registry, follow-herd commands, density telemetry |
| Culture | Layer trait vectors, divergence meters, resonance pushes |
| Military | Readiness heatmaps, cohort summaries |
| Power | Grid metrics, node list, incident feed |
| Crisis | Dashboard gauges, modifier tray, event log |
| Knowledge | Ledger overview, timeline graph, espionage mission queue |
| Logs | Streaming tracing feed, level/target/text filters, duration sparkline |
| Commands | Turn/rollback/autoplay, axis bias, spawn utilities, debug hooks |

---

## Overlay Channels

Raster overlays streamed from `core_sim`:

| Channel | Color | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `logistics` | Blue | Throughput flow |
| `sentiment` | Red | Morale/agency composite |
| `corruption` | Amber | Ledger intensity + risk weights |
| `fog` | Slate | Inverted knowledge coverage |
| `culture` | Violet | Divergence magnitude |
| `military` | Green | Readiness scalar |
| `terrain_tags` | Blended | Per-tag colors averaged |

Legend rendering: min/avg/max values + channel description.

---

## Typography & Theming

Shared `Theme` resource reads `INSPECTOR_FONT_SIZE`, applies to root `CanvasLayer`. Typography map: `body`, `heading`, `caption`, `legend`, `control`.

Helper: `Typography.gd` provides offset deltas (heading = base + 4, caption = base − 2).

---

## Scripting Capability Model

QuickJS sandbox for user scripts.

### Capability Families
- `telemetry.subscribe` - Read-only snapshot feeds with back-pressure
- `ui.compose` - Declarative widget graph (Panel, VBox, Table, Chart2D, OverlayLayer)
- `commands.issue` - Vetted command endpoints with throttle windows
- `storage.session` - Scoped key/value cache persisted with saves
- `alerts.emit` - Toast/banner notifications with rate caps

### Script Distribution
- `.sscmod` bundles (zip) with `manifest.json`, Ed25519 signature
- Local install: `mods/inspector/` or UI import
- Workshop feeds: JSON index of signed bundles

### Lifecycle
- Manifest validation on load
- Hot reload via esbuild-lite bundling
- Suspension on sandbox violations (memory/instruction limits)
