## Key Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Main.gd` | Scene orchestration, streaming toggle |
| `MapView.gd` | Terrain rendering, overlays, hex selection (select-then-cycle through a tile's band stack), navigation (WASD/QE/mouse), tile picking, and the coordinator for the **layered hex-marker system** (see Map markers below). Three cohesive subsystems are composed out into owned renderer helpers, each holding a `_view: MapView` back-ref and driven from MapView's `_ready`/`_draw` (all shared geometry/glyph/pill/fog primitives + the marker source arrays + selection state stay on MapView): the **2D minimap** (`ui/MinimapController.gd`, `_minimap`), the **primary band markers** (`ui/BandMarkerRenderer.gd`, `_band_markers`), and the **secondary markers** (`ui/SecondaryMarkerRenderer.gd`, `_secondary_markers`). Still on MapView: the `_draw_*` overlay families NOT yet extracted — terrain/shader/cache, the selected-band work-highlights + yield-labels + herd-range, supply links, routes, targeting, trade/crisis annotations (see the Step-4 report for why each was left) |
| `ui/MinimapController.gd` | Owns MapView's 2D minimap: the `MinimapPanel` instance, its terrain/FoW image (rebuilt only on grid/data/FoW change), the viewport-indicator overlay and click-to-pan. Holds a `_view: MapView` back-ref; behaviour is identical to the old inlined minimap code |
| `ui/BandMarkerRenderer.gd` | Owns MapView's PRIMARY player-band markers: the offset card-stack of settlement-stage tokens / expedition flag-discs, the faction nameplate banner (+ its reused StyleBoxFlat), the food-days dot, the travel/task arrow, and the ×N over-cap count pill. `_view: MapView` back-ref; `draw_primary_bands()` called during MapView's `_draw`; pixel-identical to the old inlined code (verified via `map_preview` byte-diff) |
| `ui/SecondaryMarkerRenderer.gd` | Owns MapView's SECONDARY markers (herds / food sites / discovered sites / harvest+scout overlays) + the per-frame edge-slot assignment (`compute_slots`) and `+N` overflow chip. Owns only the per-frame slot maps; all draw commands + shared primitives + marker source arrays stay on MapView via the `_view` back-ref. Pixel-identical to the old inlined code (verified via `map_preview` byte-diff) |
| `Inspector.gd` | Inspector coordinator: streaming fan-out, capability gating, typography; hosts per-tab panels |
| `ui/inspector/PowerPanel.gd` | Power tab panel — reference for the tab-panel extraction contract (`apply_update`/`reset`) |
| `ui/inspector/CrisisPanel.gd` | Crisis tab panel — adds command hooks (`set_command_hooks`) and `apply_typography` to the contract |
| `ui/inspector/KnowledgePanel.gd` | Knowledge tab panel — adds `set_command_connected` (connection-gating), `ingest_log_entry` (log-path telemetry), and `append_events` (Trade→Knowledge feed) |
| `ui/inspector/TradePanel.gd` | Trade tab panel — `set_map_view` (overlay), owns the Map-tab overlay toggle, and emits `knowledge_events_produced` (the coordinator forwards it to KnowledgePanel — panels stay decoupled) |
| `ui/inspector/SentimentPanel.gd` | Sentiment tab panel — display; axis bias is coordinator-owned and pushed in via `set_axis_bias` |
| `ui/inspector/VictoryPanel.gd` | Victory tab panel — display + one-shot "victory achieved" log via `set_log_hook` |
| `ui/inspector/FaunaPanel.gd` | Fauna tab panel — **display-only** herd list/detail + estimated hunt yields. The follow-herd command it used to emit was retired with the single-task fauna commands (Early-Game Labor slice 3a; hunting is now HUD labor allocation), so it issues no command; `set_command_connected` is a contract no-op |
| `ui/inspector/GreatDiscoveriesPanel.gd` | GreatDiscoveries tab panel — large, self-contained (ledger + progress + definition catalog + details); capability-gated (`CAP_MEGAPROJECTS`), no command/log/MapView coupling |
| `ui/inspector/LogsPanel.gd` | Logs tab panel — owns the LogStreamClient + polling + filters + tick sparkline; emits `log_entry_received` (coordinator dispatches to Knowledge/Trade); fed synthetic lines via `append_entry` |
| `ui/inspector/InfluencerPanel.gd` | Influencers tab panel — owns the influencer roster; capability-gated (`CAP_INDUSTRY_T1`/`T2`) via `set_available`; exposes `aggregate_resonance()` (coordinator feeds it into the Culture tab) and `get_influencers()` (coordinator's still-inline influencer command controls read the roster back). The influencer *command* controls stay coordinator-owned |
| `ui/inspector/CorruptionPanel.gd` | Corruption tab panel — display-only ledger (reputation modifier, audit capacity, incidents); not capability-gated |
| `ui/inspector/CommandsPanel.gd` | Commands tab panel — the designer/debug console (axis-bias, influencer/channel/spawn, corruption inject, heat, config reload, autoplay row, command status/log; the scenario scout/follow rows were removed with the retired single-task commands). Outbound: issues verbs via `set_command_hooks` and logs via the sink; the command transport + autoplay timer + turn-sending stay in the coordinator. Couplings are coordinator-mediated: emits `axis_bias_apply_requested` (coordinator owns `_axis_bias`, pushes back via `set_axis_bias`), `autoplay_toggled`/`autoplay_interval_changed` (coordinator drives the timer, mirrors via `set_autoplay_active`); fed the roster via `set_influencer_roster` and gated via `set_command_connected`. NOT in `_tab_panels` (no snapshot inputs) |
| `ui/inspector/OverlayPanel.gd` | "Map Overlays" section (nested inside the Map tab, attached to `OverlaySection`) — owns the overlay-channel selector (built at runtime), channel metadata, and the culture/military readouts; drives `MapView.set_overlay_channel`. Fed via `set_map_view` + `ingest(overlay_dict, terrain_tag_labels)` (the coordinator re-homes the palette → Terrain and crisis_annotations → Crisis side-routes that share the `overlays` key, and passes Terrain's tag labels since the terrain-tags channel depends on them). NOT in `_tab_panels` |
| `ui/inspector/MapPanel.gd` | Map tab panel — map-size controls, start-profile (scenario) controls, and the highlight-rivers toggle (now a shader uniform — see Edge Blending → Rivers). Snapshot-driven (in `_tab_panels`): `apply_update` consumes `grid`/`campaign_profiles`/`campaign_label`/`faction_inventory`. Issues `map_size`/`start_profile` via `set_command_hooks`, gated by `set_command_connected`, and drives `MapView.set_highlight_rivers` via `set_map_view`. The nested Map-Overlays section keeps its own `OverlayPanel` script |
| `ui/inspector/CulturePanel.gd` | Culture tab panel — culture layers, divergence list + detail, tension readout; drives `MapView.set_culture_layer_highlight`. Snapshot-driven (in `_tab_panels`): `apply_update` ingests `culture_layers`/`culture_layer_updates`/`culture_layer_removed`/`culture_tensions`, but rendering is driven by the coordinator via `render(resonance)` — the influencer-resonance "pushes" line is coordinator-mediated (`InfluencerPanel.aggregate_resonance()` passed in). `set_map_view` (highlight) + `set_log_hook` (new tensions log to the Logs feed) |
| `ui/inspector/TerrainPanel.gd` | Terrain tab panel — the largest: biome list + drill-down, tile list/detail, the runtime terrain-highlight dropdown, and the **Export Map** button (the tile Scout button was retired with the single-task `scout` command). Snapshot-driven (in `_tab_panels`): `apply_update` ingests `tiles`/`tile_updates`/`tile_removed`/`food_modules` and renders. Owns the inbound MapView hex-selection (`focus_tile_from_map`, coordinator forwards) and drives `set_terrain_highlight` / `relative_height_at` via `set_map_view`. The biome palette + tag labels arrive on the `overlays` key (coordinator routes them in via `set_terrain_palette`/`set_terrain_tag_labels`; `get_terrain_tag_labels()` feeds OverlayPanel). Export sends via `set_command_hooks`, gated by `set_command_connected` |
| `Hud.gd` | HUD layer. The **legend card** (right-dock **TerrainLegendPanel**: `update_overlay_legend` rows `{color,label,value_text}` + the terrain-only **sort header** — `Name`/`Count` toggles with a ▲/▼ arrow, display-only field ∈ {name,count} × per-field direction, default **Count desc**, persisted across map regen) and the **command feed card** are each composed out into a controller (`ui/hud/LegendController.gd` / `ui/hud/CommandFeedController.gd`); Hud holds them as `_legend` / `_command_feed` and delegates `update_overlay_legend`/`toggle_legend`/`_on_legend_sort_pressed` and `ingest_command_events`/`reset_command_feed`/`_note_command_feed`. MapView's `_build_terrain_legend` supplies a numeric `count` per row for the count sort; non-terrain (overlay/tag) legends hide the sort control. Also: the split **Tile card** (`TilePanel`/`%TileDetail` — terrain + the `%ForageAssignControls` "assign foragers" stepper) + **Occupants roster card** (`OccupantsPanel`/`%RosterList`/`%OccupantDetail` — selectable bands+wildlife roster with a per-occupant detail drawer for **herds/expeditions**; a herd shows the `%HerdAssignControls` "assign hunters" stepper+policy picker, an expedition the `%AllocationPanel` Recall/Move panel). **Player-band detail relocated into the dockable `BandCityPanel`** (summary + `%AllocationPanel`-style labor UI render there via `_render_band_into_panel`; the Occupants card keeps only the roster row) — see "Band/City dockable panel". Turn readout (the standalone band Alerts panel was folded into the turn-orb attention model — see "Turn orb & attention model"). Both cards + all selection state (`_selected_tile_info`/`_selected_unit`/`_selected_herd`) + the snapshot-captured `_player_band` (and `_player_bands`, the full player-faction list backing the band-picker + the panel cycler) live here; roster selection emits `roster_occupant_selected`; labor edits emit `assign_labor_requested` / `move_band_requested` / `cancel_order_requested` (clear-all) |
| `ui/hud/LegendController.gd` | Owns the right-dock legend card: row rendering, the terrain-only Name/Count sort header + its display-only sort state, the suppress toggle, and internal-scroll sizing. `HudLayer.LEGEND_SORT_FIELD_*` alias to its `SORT_FIELD_*` consts. Behaviour identical to the old inlined legend code |
| `ui/hud/CommandFeedController.gd` | Owns the left-dock command feed card: the rolling entry list, signature de-duplication (`ingest_events`), client `note()`s, and the internal-scroll sizing. Behaviour identical to the old inlined feed code |
| `ui/BandCityPanel.gd` / `.tscn` | The dockable **Band/City command center** CanvasLayer — persistent whenever ≥1 player band exists, dockable to any of the 4 edges (default left, persisted to `user://band_city_dock.cfg`) + collapse-to-rail. Header (stage glyph/name/label + `◀ n/N ▶` cycler + 2×2 dock chooser + collapse), body hosts the relocated band detail as **section blocks** via `set_band_sections` (tall = vertical stack that fits its width to the content, wide = manual balanced-column packing that fits its height to the content). Reserves its edge via `reservation_changed(edge, size)` → `Main._apply_reservation(&"band_panel", …)`. See "Band/City dockable panel" + `docs/plan_band_city_dock.md` |
| `ui/BandFoodStatus.gd` | Single source of truth for band food-supply thresholds (`band_status_config.json`) + the days→green/amber/red color / BBCode-hex mapping (plus the parallel morale warn/critical thresholds + `color_for_morale`/`hex_for_morale`), shared by MapView's band dot and Hud's food/morale lines + alerts |
| `ui/PenStatus.gd` | Single source of truth for **"is this pen's herd starving?"** — `FULLY_FED` / `FED_EPSILON` + `fed_fraction(herd)` / `is_starving(fed)`, reading `HerdTelemetryState.penFedFraction` (`< 1` ⇒ the keeper underpaid the pen's feed, so the herd is SHRINKING every turn). Plus `herd_is_starving(herd)` for a caller holding only the herd dict. The ONE test all three surfaces ask — the herd drawer (`Hud._corral_label` + the Pen feed row), the map's distress badge (`MapView._draw_herd`) and the turn orb's `starving_pen` producer — so they can never disagree about which pen is dying |
| `ui/TileHabitability.gd` | Single source of truth for the Tile-card Habitability rating: buckets `TileState.habitability` (band-independent per-turn morale drain) into Hospitable/Fair/Harsh/Hostile via `tile_habitability_config.json` thresholds, with the HEALTHY/INK/WARN/DANGER color / `hex_for_rating` mapping. Consumed by `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` + `_format_detail_bbcode` |
| `ui/TileClimate.gd` | Single source of truth for the Tile-card Climate band: maps `TileState.temperature` (°, a latitude+elevation climate, equator-in-the-middle) into Tropical/Warm/Temperate/Cool/Polar via `tile_climate_config.json` cutoffs. INFORMATIONAL only — deliberately no HEALTHY/WARN/DANGER tint (renders neutral ink), so it doesn't compete with the Habitability row's semantic palette. Consumed by `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` |
| `ui/RiverEdges.gd` | Single source of truth for the TEXT reading of hex-EDGE rivers: owns the class vocabulary (Minor/Major), the 6 direction names, and the mask bit-widths as named constants, and formats `TileState.riverEdges` into `Major River: NE, NW` / `Minor River: SW` rows (`summary_lines`, Major first, directions in compass order from NE). Consumed by BOTH `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` (Tile card) and `Hud.show_tooltip` (map hover) — one formatter, two surfaces. See Edge Blending → Rivers |
| `SnapshotStream.gd` | Consumes length-prefixed FlatBuffers snapshots |
| `CommandBridge.gd` | Issues Protobuf commands to server |
| `ui/MinimapPanel.gd` | Minimap component for the 2D map view (click-to-pan, aspect ratio sizing) |
| `ui/TurnOrb.gd` / `ui/TurnOrb.tscn` | The bottom-right **turn orb** (replaces the old "Advance Turn" button): calm cyan pulse when the attention registry is empty, else a severity-tinted count badge + a reasons popover (see "Turn orb & attention model"). Re-emits `focus_requested` (jump) / `advance_requested` so Main's advance/jump wiring is unchanged; palette from `HudStyle`, all geometry/severity/kind as named constants |
| `ui/MagnifierButton.gd` | Zoom-rail in/out button that `_draw`s a crisp magnifier icon (lens + handle + inner `+`/`−`, `zoom_sign` picks which) — font magnifier glyphs render as tofu/blobs. Monochrome `HudStyle` ink → `SIGNAL` on hover |
| `ui/AutoSizingPanel.gd` | Shared helper for panels that expand to fit content |
| `ui/HudStyle.gd` | Single source of truth for the dark HUD console look: palette (cyan `SIGNAL`, amber `WARN`, ink/line neutrals), `card_stylebox()`, `header_stylebox()`, `banner_stylebox()`, `apply_button(btn, "primary"/"ghost"/"armed")`, and `apply_link_button(btn, base_color)` — the **inline link** treatment for a clickable label inside a row (no box at rest; hover tint + cyan text + pointing hand), used by the band panel's clickable Current-actions rows. Every HUD surface styles through here |
| `ui/FoodIcons.gd` | Shared glyph vocabulary — food modules (`for_site`, which takes an optional tile `terrain_id`: **`riverine_delta` splits fish 🐟 ↔ reeds 🎋** — dry floodplain LAND (`alluvial_plain`/`floodplain`) reads as reeds via `RIVERINE_REED_ICON`, open `navigable_river` keeps 🐟; MapView stamps each food site's `terrain_id` so the map marker + HUD Forage row resolve the same glyph), fauna herds (`for_herd`, species keyword matched in the herd label, longest-first), and **take policies** (`for_policy`, `POLICY_ICONS`: the four extractive rungs sustain ♻ / surplus ⬆ / market ⇄ / eradicate 💀, plus the **four investment** rungs of the Intensification Ladder — cultivate 🌱 / sow ▦ / tame ◎ / corral 🐄. Each verb wears the glyph of **the rung it builds** (🌱 the crop, ▦ the plotted Field, ◎ the pastoral herd that now keeps near your camp — the rung's defining effect is proximity — 🐄 the penned livestock; 🐄 is also the herd drawer's Domesticated/Corralled badge, and ▦ the tile card's `▦ Field` badge). Verified legible at picker size in `forage_cultivate.png` / `forage_sow.png` / `two_meter_split.png` / `herd_corral.png`; `""` for unknown). Used by the map's food-site / herd markers (`MapView._draw_food_site` / `_draw_herd`), the Harvest/Hunt button + the **band panel's Current-actions rows** (each row leads with its resource glyph), and — for policies — BOTH the Hud policy-picker buttons (`_build_policy_picker`) and the map's yield labels (`MapView._draw_yield_label` appends the icon: `+0.38 ♻`), so a resource/policy always reads the same on the panel and on the map. **Policy glyphs are deliberately TEXT-PRESENTATION symbols** (♻ ⬆ ⇄ ▦ ◎) plus the high-contrast 💀: pictographic emoji (🪙 coin, 💰 money bag) render as a featureless grey blob at the ~12–13px these are drawn at, and ⚖ renders tiny/faint — same glyph-legibility hazard that forced `MagnifierButton` to hand-draw. Verified in `band_panel_left.png` / `map_band_work.png`. **The mechanism is sharper than "prefer line art", and it decides the choice:** a text-presentation glyph **inherits the label's font colour**, so it renders at the button's full contrast and greys out *with* the button when a rung is disabled; an **emoji carries its own colours and cannot be tinted**, so it renders at whatever contrast its art happens to have and stays stubbornly coloured while disabled. 🐾 was tried for `tame` and rejected on exactly that — at picker size it came out a faint washed-out tan against the dark console, the weakest glyph in a row next to a crisp white 💀 (see the first cut of `two_meter_split.png`) — and ◎ replaced it. Prefer a text-presentation symbol for any NEW policy glyph; the surviving emoji (💀 🌱 🐄) are grandfathered and legible. Also the **action-status** glyphs (`for_status`, `STATUS_ICONS`) the Band panel's Current-actions + Active-expeditions rows use instead of words — `pending ○` (the ORDER isn't acknowledged yet; a modifier that rides on any row, amber) / `working ●` (a confirmed local forage/hunt row, and expedition phase `hunting`) / `outbound ➤` / `awaiting ▮▮` / `delivering ◄` = `returning ◄` (both are "coming home"; the tooltip distinguishes them). Same line-art rule and the same hazard: `◌` (dotted circle) was tried for `pending` and rejected — it renders thin and faint at row size — and `⏸` for `awaiting` carries emoji presentation (tofu/blob), so `▮▮` is used. Verified at true size in `band_panel_status_glyphs.png` |
| `tools/ui_preview.gd` / `.tscn` | Dev-only preview harness: instances the real `HudLayer` with canned selection/targeting data, renders each state, and saves PNGs to `ui_preview_out/` (gitignored). Iterate on HUD styling without a server: `godot --path . res://tools/ui_preview.tscn` |
| `tools/map_preview.gd` / `.tscn` | Dev-only **MapView** preview harness (HUD-only ui_preview's companion): instances the real `MapView`, feeds a canned `display_snapshot` + selects a band, and dumps PNGs (`map_*.png`) to `ui_preview_out/`. Verifies the selected-band labor highlights (work-range ring / worked forage tiles / hunted-herd ring+link; scouting draws no disc — it extends sight in the fog), the terrain/blend states, and the **rivers** state (`map_rivers*.png` — hex-edge Minor/Major rivers + the NavigableRiver terrain chain, incl. `map_rivers_join.png`: a zoomed, hex-anchored close-up of the trunk HEAD, where two tributaries hand over at corners — the frame the `river_inflow` spurs are judged on — `map_rivers_head_minor.png`: a second navigable head fed by a **Minor tributary only**, the frame the HEAD TAPER is judged on; **`map_rivers_midchain.png`**: a Minor tributary handing over at a vertex of a **MID-CHAIN** trunk hex (upstream *and* downstream channel exits) — the frame the head-taper's **exit-count gate** is judged on: the trunk must hold **constant full width through the junction** (any pinch-and-swell at the hex centre is the HOURGLASS the gate exists to prevent) while the spur still reaches its vertex. The case the drainage-network rewrite created and the fixtures never had; **`map_rivers_notch.png`**: a chain HEAD whose tributary hands over at its BOTTOM vertex (corner 1) and whose single channel exit is the ADJACENT SW side — both flanking the same corner, the geometry the old centre-hub routing drew a NOTCH / inverted-V on. The direct inflow-corner→exit-midpoint routing must draw ONE smooth tapered channel with no notch (zoomed via `NOTCH_ZOOM_IN`); **`map_rivers_lake_alongside.png`**: a one-hex `inland_sea` ringed by three navigable hexes whose `river_channel` exits all run along their own chain / out to the sea — NONE into the lake (the @21,61 case). The shore pass's per-edge MOUTH test must draw the lake's FULL beach/foam ring INCLUDING the navigable-adjacent edges (the old "any navigable adjacency" exclusion ate them); the true mouth into the eastern sea in the same frame STAYS open; and `map_rivers_web.png`: a solid CLUMP of adjacent navigable hexes with `river_channel` winding through it as ONE snake — the **regression guard** for the spider-web bug, since the other river fixtures build their chain by hand and are paths by construction, which is why the harness never caught it. Any cross-link/triangle there = the terrain-inferred arm rule is back) and the **starving-pen distress badge** (`map_herd_starving` — a starving pen beside a fed one) Also state **"pasture"** (`map_pasture.png`) — the **graze distribution** on an earthlike-shaped fixture map under the `pasture` overlay channel (see Overlay Channels): the frame Phase 2a exists to be judged on (is prairie really pasture? is the alluvial fallback dominant? are glacier/lava/water distinct from merely-poor ground?). It stages a **woodland block a live map does not have** (the palette thins forest out), sizes the window to the grid's aspect (MapView is **cover-fit**, so a mismatch CROPS exactly the distribution you came to see), and **prints the legend dict** (this harness has no HUD to draw it into). Also state **"forage"** (`map_forage.png`) — the **human-food distribution**, the SAME earthlike fixture painted from the human-food table under the `forage` channel, so it compares tile-for-tile with `map_pasture` and the two food webs' divergence reads directly (forest/river rich on forage / poor on pasture; the shelf column glows on forage where it is barren on pasture) without a server: `godot --path . res://tools/map_preview.tscn` |
| `tools/blend_probe.gd` / `.tscn` | Dev-only **edge-blend probe rendered at the GAME's on-screen hex radius** — the other harnesses *fit* their grid to the window (r ≈ 83–178) and the blend look is radius-relative, so every judgement made in a fitted frame was wrong. Pins a 1:1 1920×1080 canvas + a grid sized so `_fit_map_to_view` lands on the target radius (it prints the achieved radius and warns if it drifts). **Two states:** (1) a **band strip** of flat biomes at r≈45 (desert · prairie · scrub · alluvial · tundra · salt flat — every adjacent pair is a flat↔flat seam) → `blend_bands_*.png`; (2) **ISOLATED prairie hexes surrounded on all six sides by dark rocky soil** at **r≈75** (the user's on-screen size) → `blend_isolated_shipped.png` + one full frame & native-res close-up per tuning variant + a labelled contact sheet (`V6_*.png`). **State 2 is mandatory for any blend change**: a straight band seam looks fine even when the blend is tearing holes in hex interiors — only a surrounded hex exposes it (that is how the shredding regression shipped). **Two more states (V7, water↔water):** (3) an irregular **deep-ocean region embedded in continental shelf** (plus isolated deep hexes) at r≈77 → `V7_water_W1.png` (water on the shared LAND levers — still a soft-edged hexagon) vs `V7_water_W2.png` (the shipped `water_blend` block — the silhouette dissolves); (4) a ragged **coast** frame with a single water id → `V7_coast_unchanged.png`, the **bit-identical reference** any blend-eligibility change is pixel-diffed against (it must not move the shoreline). **Two more states:** (5, V8) the water patch rendered **FoW OFF vs FoW ON** (a mix of active + discovered hexes, nothing unexplored) → `V8_water_fow_off.png` / `V8_water_fow_on.png` — the FoW tint comes from a **per-hex, NEAREST-sampled vis-map**, which used to make every discovered↔active adjacency a **hard hex-shaped tint boundary that is not a terrain seam**. Any "hard straight edges are back" report must be checked against this pair BEFORE the blend is touched. This is also the frame the **FoW boundary softening** is judged on (see Fog-of-war softening: the steps must be gone, pure states unchanged); (6, V10) the shipped **shoreline profile** on the ragged coast at r≈75, rendered against TWO land biomes → `V10_shore.png` + `V10_shore_closeup.png` (prairie) and **`V10_shore_dark_land.png` + `V10_shore_dark_land_closeup.png`** (rocky_regolith). The close-ups are where the "is there a hard line anywhere on land→sand→foam→water?" call is made (the downscaled full frame hides a 1px line; see Shoreline), and **the DARK-land one is decisive** — prairie's tan hides sand-vs-land contrast and masked an invisible-beach bug through several passes, so never judge the beach on prairie alone. `_render_variant(overrides, name, crop…)` overrides any `terrain_config` lever (incl. the nested `water_blend` / `shore` blocks) live, which is how the shipped values were swept. **One more state (8, W): the FoW hex-step BEFORE vs AFTER the boundary softening** — one camera, one terrain, one visibility map, only `fow_softness` varying → `W_fow_off.png` (FoW off, the terrain-only reference: the deep-ocean blob's edges are already soft, which **exonerates the blend**), `W_fow_on.png` (softness `0` — reproduces the **unsmoothed per-hex tint**, i.e. the hard hexagonal brightness steps), `W_fow_fixed.png` (the shipped softness — steps gone, mist preserved). Each also dumps a `_closeup` and, decisively, a **`_same_terrain`** crop straddling hexes **(4,3) Active / (3,3) Discovered — BOTH continental shelf**, so the only thing that can draw an edge between them is the FoW tint. That crop answers any "hard straight edges in open water, even between hexes of the same terrain" report. **One more state (9, X): the DARK-WATER report on REAL game terrain** → `X_dark_water.png` + `X_dark_water_closeup.png`, rendered from a **verbatim 14×10 window of a LIVE snapshot's id-map** (`X_WATER_IDS`), FoW OFF, r≈75. The synthetic water states (3/5/8) never reproduced the "dark patches of open water with hard full-hexagon edges" report because their deep-ocean region is ONE clean ragged blob; the real ocean is **salt-and-pepper** shelf/deep, and a lone deep hex ringed by shelf can only read as a dark HEXAGON. **Any "dark water hexagons" report must be rendered on THIS state** — a synthetic blob will not show it. It is the frame the water **depth field** (see Edge Blending → water) was verified against. **One more state (10, L): the PER-WATER-TERRAIN shore profile on a SMALL INLAND SEA** → `L1_current.png` / `L2_no_wisp.png` / `L3_half.png` / `L4_tenth.png` (+ `*_full.png`), a 7-hex `inland_sea` lake in a field of **dark rocky_regolith** (prairie's tan camouflages both sand and foam) at r≈75, one camera/crop across all four. `_render_lake_variant` overrides the inland_sea entry's `shore_profile` in the live config and calls `TerrainTextureManager.rebuild_layer_shore_map()` — the sweep for choosing a lake's coast (now in the three-scale scheme; **L3 IS the shipped lake**, `sand 0.5 / foam 0.5 / wisp 0`, and L4 = the whole profile scaled so its OUTERMOST reach, `wisp_center + wisp_half` = 0.68·r, lands at ~0.10·r → 0.147). **The harness disables `MapView._unhandled_input`** — it renders in a REAL window, so the OS cursor otherwise drew a faint HOVER hex outline into the frames, a run-to-run difference of a few thousand pixels that silently defeats the pixel-diff the coast states exist for. With it off, consecutive runs are **byte-identical**, so `V7_coast_unchanged.png` / `V10_shore*.png` are usable as strict bit-identity references. **One more state (11, H): ROLLING HILLS "cut off at the hex edge"** → `H_*.png`, a `rolling_hills` (24) blob + **isolated** hills hexes + an **isolated alpine (26)** hex in a field that is dark `rocky_reg` west / tan `prairie` east, at r≈75 with the **hex grid overlay OFF** (a drawn hexagon would answer the very question under test). Frames: `H_before` (the artifact), **`H_base_only`** (peaks skipped by pushing `peak_min_radius` above the render radius — isolates the BASE floor, and is what proved the cut is the rugged base hexagon, **not** a weak mound overhang), `H_peaks_only` (the amplified `before − base_only` pixel diff = the peak pass's exact footprint: it shows the mounds DO overhang, and that the peak **cast shadow darkens the whole neighbour hex**, a second hard hexagon), and the candidate fixes `H_fix_overhang` / **`H_fix_base`** (`blend_rugged_land`) / `H_fix_both`. Each renders a full frame + a seam close-up + the **isolated-hex** and **alpine** close-ups (the mandatory shred checks). `H_gate_bands_full` / `H_gate_coast` re-render the flat↔flat strip and the coast with the rugged gate ON — they must byte-compare **identical** to `blend_bands_full` / `V7_coast_unchanged`. **One more state (12, R): the RUGGED-GATE SWEEP** — `blend_rugged_land` is GLOBAL, so shipping it lets EVERY rugged biome's base floor blend, and the failure mode is SHREDDING. R renders **each rugged biome as an ISOLATED hex** (even col + even row ⇒ never adjacent to another subject) in TWO fields, each **gate OFF vs gate ON** so every biome is a controlled A/B: `R_flatoff_*` / `R_flat_*` (dark `rocky_reg` west, tan `prairie` east) and `R_ruggedoff_*` / `R_rugged_*` (a field of `canyon_badlands` — the rugged↔rugged case), plus `R_*_field_full`. **The gate-OFF pair is not optional**: several biomes' own art (e.g. `karst_highland`'s semi-transparent overhanging spires) *looks* like neighbour texture leaking into the hex, and only the A/B tells art from tear. **One more state (13, S): the PEAK CAST-SHADOW HEXAGONS** — an alpine massif + an isolated `rolling_hills` hex in a light prairie field, grid OFF → `S_shadow.png` + `_closeup` + `_iso`, and decisively **`S_shadow_footprint*.png`**, the amplified diff against a `shadow_strength = 0` render (the cast shadow **in isolation** — the only frame on which "is it hex-shaped? is it still directional?" can actually be answered, since the semi-transparent mound fringe contaminates every other measurement). **Two harness bugs were fixed here and must not regress:** (a) `project.godot` opens the window **MAXIMIZED** (`window/size/mode=3`) and the WM applies that a few frames into the run — *after* `_ready` sized it — so the viewport became the whole monitor and every state after the second silently rendered at **r ≈ 154, not the game's 75** (and the taller states overflowed the canvas, clipping the close-ups). `_pin_canvas` re-asserts WINDOWED + 1920×1080 on every `_refit`. (b) Lever overrides now go through **`_override_config`/`_restore_config`**, which **ERASE** a key that was absent instead of writing `null` back: MapView reads levers as `bool(config.get(key, DEFAULT))`, the default only applies when the key is **missing**, and a present-but-null key reaches `bool(null)` — a **runtime error that aborts `_update_terrain_shader_quad` before it pushes a single uniform**, so every later frame renders with STALE uniforms and lies. **One more state (14, G): the REAL NEIGHBOURHOOD from the user's screenshot** — the "hills are STILL cut off, with the rugged gate ON" report → `G_*.png`. State H could not see why: its hills blob sits in FLAT fields only, so every peak edge in it is a peak↔non-peak one (which the overhang feathers). G rebuilds the screenshot — a `rolling_hills` blob against `canyon_badlands` (rugged, **no** peak asset), **`alpine_mountain` (which HAS one → the peak↔PEAK case)**, `high_plateau` (a peak at ~the SAME elevation as the hills → the near-zero-Δ case), `alluvial_plain`, `rocky_reg` and an `inland_sea` lake hex — at r ≈ 75, grid OFF. It is the **only** probe state that ships a real **elevation raster** (`G_ELEVATION_BY_ID` + `elevation_sea_level`): every other snapshot omits the channel, so MapView falls back to `PEAK_ELEV_FALLBACK` for EVERY hex and **no elevation asymmetry can be judged in them**. Frames: `G_before` (shipped), **`G_no_peaks`** (peak pass skipped — it renders the same seam as a soft ecotone, which **exonerated the base blend** and convicted the peak overlay), `G_no_shadow` (cast shadow off, peaks on — attributes a residual line to the shadow vs the art), `G_peaks_only` (the amplified diff = the peak pass's exact footprint), each with native-res crops `_peakpeak` (hills↔alpine, big Δelev), `_sameelev` (hills↔plateau, Δ≈0 → must stay a soft symmetric cross-fade), `_canyon` (peak↔non-peak — the control), `_lake` (the shoreline — hard BY DESIGN), `_iso` + `_iso_alpine` (the mandatory isolated-hex shred checks; both sit on the LEFT of the frame because MapView's minimap CanvasLayer is NOT hidden and a bottom-right crop captures IT). **A `--only=` state filter** (`godot --path . res://tools/blend_probe.tscn -- --only=G`, or `--only=1,4,G`; keys are `<number>/<letter>`, no filter = every state) renders one state instead of all 14 — a diagnosis loop re-renders one state many times. **A third harness bug was fixed here and must not regress:** `project.godot` opens the window **MAXIMIZED** and macOS applies — and **RE-applies** — that asynchronously, many frames in, so a fixed pair of `process_frame`s is a RACE that does not stay won. A filtered run puts a radius-critical state FIRST and it fitted at **r ≈ 154, not the game's 75**; a re-maximize BETWEEN two frames of one state rendered them at different resolutions (the pixel-diff then dies on a size mismatch); and one DURING a crop sequence made the captured image the monitor's while the viewport still reported the pinned size (`content_scale_size` pins the viewport, so **only `get_window().size` can see the maximize**) — the crop then landed off-frame as a 686×1 sliver. `_ensure_canvas` (called from `_settle`) re-pins and WAITS on the window; `_capture` re-draws until the captured geometry is the canvas's (or an integer HiDPI multiple) instead of silently saving a bad frame. **One more state (15, D): the THREE-SCALE shore profile — CLIFF vs BEACH vs LAKE, and the MIXED coast** → `D*.png`, the ragged coast against **dark `rocky_reg`** (prairie's tan camouflages both sand and foam) at r≈75, **grid overlay OFF**, one camera/crop per comparison set. `_snapshot_coast(shore_id, water_id)` now takes the SEA's id, which is what selects the `shore_profile` under test. Frames: **`D1_cliff`** (`deep_ocean` meeting land — NO sand anywhere, big surf, and the full-strength surf peak must still conceal the base's own step at the waterline, since there is no sand out there to hide it); **`D2_shelf_C1/C2/C3`** (the shelf's muting ladder, `foam_scale` 0.85/0.75/0.65 × `wisp_scale` 0.5 — the surf's measured footprint falls 18.0k → 15.8k → 13.9k → 12.2k px against the cliff's; **C2 ships**); **`D3_mixed_coast`** — THE DECISIVE FRAME: a `deep_ocean` hex and a `continental_shelf` hex **adjacent along ONE coastline**, both touching the same land (`_snapshot_mixed_coast` swaps the sea by row), where a nearest-water PICK would jump the profile at their bisector and make the sand appear along a **hard line**; the weighted-mean profile field must instead **fade the beach in** along the shore (measured: the land-pixel difference vs `D1_cliff` ramps from 0.00 over ~220px ≈ 3 hex radii — not a step); and **`D4_lake_unchanged`** (the lake, shipped config — the two-lever → three-scale migration must be a no-op). **One more state (16, SURF): THE BRIGHT WHITE SHORELINE OUTLINE** → `W_*.png`, the state the **waterline base cross-fade** + **`foam_opacity`** were built and chosen on (r≈75, grid OFF; the archipelago frames also render at **r≈30 — map scale**, which is the zoom the complaint was made at). The report was that the surf reads as "an obvious bright white outline on most land". Every frame uses the **MIXED coast** (`_snapshot_mixed_coast`: deep_ocean CLIFF in the north rows, continental_shelf BEACH in the south, both against **dark rocky_reg**) so each rung is cropped on **both coast types at once** (`_cliff` / `_beach`) — they fail differently. Frames: `W_base` (the shipped near-white ring — the complaint, and it is unmistakable); **`W_optA_1/2/3`** (option A, the **recolour-only** ladder: still an OPAQUE ring, just greyer — rendered so the "just make it grey" idea can be *seen* to be insufficient); **`W_optB_1/2/3`** (option B's `foam_opacity` ladder 0.35/0.55/0.75 on the cross-fade + muted colour; **0.55 ships**); and **THE MAKE-OR-BREAK PAIR — `W_step_control` vs `W_optB_step_check`**, the CLIFF coast with the **foam disabled entirely** (`foam_opacity 0` kills surf *and* wisp): the control (cross-fade also off) shows the **raw base step — a razor-straight hex-edge cut**, which is what the opaque foam was hiding all along, and the step check must show it GONE. **Any change to the surf must re-render that pair** — a translucent surf over a live base step is exactly the bug that broke this shoreline four times. `W_step_wl_1/2/3` is the `waterline_width` sweep it was chosen on (0.08 dissolves the step, **0.14** reads as a wet-rock rim, 0.20 ghosts land pebbles out to sea). **Judge the step check at 4× magnification** — at 1:1 the cross-fade and the razor step look nearly identical, and the first (too-narrow) cut was wrongly passed by eye before the magnified strip caught it. `W_base_wide` / `W_optB_wide` (+ `_farzoom`) are the **archipelago** (`_snapshot_archipelago` — islands on a lattice, alternating shelf-ringed BEACH coasts and deep-touching CLIFF coasts, so both types are in one frame; deterministic and grid-size independent, so the same map renders at r≈75 and at map scale): **`W_base_farzoom` vs `W_optB_farzoom` is the frame that actually answers the complaint.** **One more state (17, BANK): the NAVIGABLE-RIVER BANK CORRIDOR reading as a CHAIN OF HEXAGONS** → `BANK_*.png`, the state the per-terrain **`blend_profile`** (see Edge Blending) was diagnosed and chosen on. A navigable hex is a silty **bank** whose `blend_class` is `flat`, so the flat↔flat interlock IS eligible on its land edges — and a shader probe (tint the mix factor `t` on id 37) confirmed it **FIRES**: this was never a gate/eligibility bug, and no amount of re-checking `blend_class` or the water gates will find one. It is a LOOK failure — the global ecotone is ~`0.35·r` wide and near-straight, which is invisible between two tan grasslands and glaring between grey gravel and orange grass. The frame renders the corridor (a real `river_channel` chain, so the water draws) at the game's **r ≈ 75** crossing a field that is **floodplain (9, luma 58) in its west half and prairie (11, luma 112) in its east** — **both ends of the brightness range a river corridor actually touches, in ONE frame**, because the bank is *darker* than prairie but *brighter* than floodplain and a fix tuned against only one of them fails on the other. Plus an **ISOLATED bank hex in each field** (the mandatory shred crops — a corridor seam cannot show a torn interior; they sit in the TOP rows because a bottom-right crop captures MapView's minimap). `_render_bank_variant` sweeps the profile live via `_set_blend_profile` + `TerrainTextureManager.rebuild_layer_blend_map()`: **`BANK_off` is the NEUTRAL profile — i.e. the BEFORE**, the shipped global levers, in the same camera, and it reproduces the report exactly. `BANK_v1/v2/v3` are the ladder (**v2 = 2.6/2.2/2.6 SHIPS**; v1 still traces the hexagon, v3 dissolves the bank) and `BANK_shipped` is config's. `godot --path . res://tools/blend_probe.tscn` (or `-- --only=SURF` / `-- --only=BANK`) |
| `tools/band_panel_preview.gd` / `.tscn` | Dev-only preview harness for the **Band/City dockable panel**: instances the real `BandCityPanel` + `HudLayer`, injects the panel into the HUD, pushes a seeded player band through `update_band_alerts`, and dumps the panel docked left/right/top/bottom + collapsed (`band_panel_*.png`) so the chrome + the relocated band detail + the HUD reflow can be eyeballed without a server: `godot --path . res://tools/band_panel_preview.tscn` |
| `tools/marker_field_guard.gd` / `.tscn` | Headless **regression guard** for the "unit marker drops a panel-consumed field" bug class (twice hit: `hunt_mode`, then `working_age`/`idle_workers`). Feeds one realistic population entry through the real `MapView._rebuild_unit_markers` and asserts the produced marker is a superset of `PANEL_CONSUMED_KEYS` (the keys `Hud._unit_summary_lines` + `_build_allocation_panel` read off `_selected_unit`) and that the drop-prone fields round-trip (not defaulted). Exits non-zero on failure (CI-usable). No rendering, so headless: `godot --headless --path . res://tools/marker_field_guard.tscn`. When the panel starts reading a new marker field, add it to `PANEL_CONSUMED_KEYS`. |

## Architecture

### Scene Structure
- `Main.tscn` - Root `Node2D` scene with a `Camera2D`, the `MapView` map layer, and `CanvasLayer`s for HUD/inspector/Band-City panel
- The client is **2D-only**; an experimental 3D relief view was permanently removed (see `docs/architecture.md` → "Removed: 3D Relief Rendering")
- Toggle: `I` hides/shows inspector, `L` collapses legend

### Data Flow
```
Server (FlatBuffers) -> SnapshotStream.gd -> parsed snapshot
                                          -> MapView (terrain/overlays)
                                          -> Inspector (panels)
                                          -> Hud (legend, selection)
```

### Native Extension
`native/` contains GDExtension bindings for FlatBuffers decoding (generated from `sim_schema/schemas/snapshot.fbs`).

> **Note:** Elevation is not rendered as 3D relief. A shallow-3D heightfield view was
> prototyped and permanently removed; elevation is surfaced as the 2D **Elevation
> Heatmap** overlay and as a per-tile **Height** readout in the tile panels (the HUD
> selection panel via `MapView._tile_info_at` → `Hud._tile_summary_lines`, and the
> Inspector Terrain tab). All read the same normalized `ElevationOverlay.samples` raster —
> there is no per-tile elevation on `TileState`. **Height is a relative 0..100 indicator**
> (a number + filled/empty bar), NOT meters: it exists so a player can reason about line of
> sight — a higher tile can occlude the tile behind it (matching the LOS raycast in
> `visibility_systems.rs`). `MapView.relative_height_at` rescales the above-sea-level span
> into 0..100 (at/below sea level reads 0, since open water occludes nothing). The sea level
> is the **active map's** `sea_level`, streamed per-snapshot as `ElevationOverlay.seaLevel`
> (pre-normalized server-side to the raster's [min,max] scale) and read into
> `MapView._elevation_sea_level` — no hardcode; `HEIGHT_DEFAULT_SEA_LEVEL` is only the
> pre-first-snapshot fallback. `MapView.format_height` is the single source of truth for the
> number+bar formatting. The
> raster still streams from the core for the heatmap and for gameplay (LOS), but the
> per-vertex `normals` field (3D-only) was dropped from the schema. See
> `docs/architecture.md` → "Removed: 3D Relief Rendering".

## Minimap System

The 2D minimap lives in the HUD **bottom-left** `NavCluster` (an HBox in `BottomBar`,
`HudLayer.tscn`) — a `MinimapContainer` (the map thumbnail with its viewport indicator
rectangle) with a docked **zoom rail** to its right. `MapView._setup_2d_minimap` finds the
container via `Hud.get_minimap_container()`, so the container abstracts the move.

### Zoom rail — the on-screen map-zoom control
The rail (`ZoomRail` VBox) is `＋` (`MagnifierButton`, zoom in) / a live `1.0×` readout /
`－` (`MagnifierButton`, zoom out) / `▣` fit ("Fit map to view (C)"). It rides the **one**
map-zoom path: the buttons emit `Hud.map_zoom_step(±1)` / `map_zoom_fit` → `Main` →
`MapView.zoom_step()` / `fit_to_view()` (thin wrappers over `_apply_zoom`, pivoting on the
map center), and `MapView.zoom_changed(zoom_factor)` → `Hud.set_zoom_readout` renders the
readout (so it also reflects the wheel and `Q`/`E`). The old top-right **interface-scale**
widget (which drove `content_scale_factor` — it scaled the whole canvas uniformly, so map
icons never crossed the icon-LOD threshold) was **removed**; map zoom is now solely
`MapView._apply_zoom`. Interface scale returns later via an Options menu. See
`docs/plan_hud_nav_turn_orb.md`.

The map view displays this minimap showing the full map with a viewport indicator rectangle.

### Component (`ui/MinimapPanel.gd`)
Reusable minimap UI component handling:
- CanvasLayer hierarchy setup (layer 102)
- Aspect ratio sizing from grid dimensions
- Click-to-pan with drag support
- Viewport indicator overlay with draw callbacks

### 2D Minimap (MapView.gd)
- Renders terrain at 1 pixel per hex as an `ImageTexture`
- Viewport indicator uses pointy-top hex coordinate math:
  - Screen corners → axial coords (q,r) → offset coords (col,row) → normalized [0,1]
- Click-to-pan converts normalized position → hex grid coords → pan_offset

### Configuration
Minimap sizing parameters live in `heightfield_config.json` (the file also holds fog-of-war appearance tunables; its 3D-relief sections were removed):
```json
"minimap": {
  "base_height": 220,
  "min_width": 140.0,
  "max_width": 520.0,
  "margin": 16.0
}
```

## Terrain Texture System

Optional terrain texture graphics for the 2D map view.

### Asset Structure

  TerrainDefinitions.gd          # Single source of truth for terrain definitions
  TerrainTextureGenerator.gd     # CLI script to generate placeholder textures
```

### Enabling Terrain Textures
1. Generate placeholder textures from command line:
   ```bash
   godot --headless --path clients/godot_thin_client --script assets/terrain/TerrainTextureGenerator.gd
   ```
2. Replace placeholders in `assets/terrain/textures/base/` with AI-generated or hand-crafted textures
3. Set `"use_terrain_textures": true` in `terrain_config.json`

Textures are loaded at runtime from individual PNGs and combined into a `Texture2DArray`.

### Configuration (`terrain_config.json`)
```json
{
  "use_terrain_textures": true,
  "use_edge_blending": true,
  "texture_scale": 4.0,
  "blend_width": 0.25,
  "blend_soft": 0.35,
  "blend_height_influence": 0.25,
  "blend_noise_scale": 0.25,
  "blend_noise_amount": 0.3,
  "feature_noise_cell": 6.0,
  "water_blend": { "blend_width": 0.45, "blend_soft": 0.45, "blend_noise_amount": 0.45 },
  "lod_near_distance": 50.0,
  "lod_far_distance": 200.0
}
```
Every terrain entry also carries a `"blend_class"` (`flat` | `water` | `rugged`) — the single
source of truth for edge-blend eligibility, which is **same-class** (flat↔flat and water↔water blend;
land↔water and rugged stay hard — see Edge Blending below) — and may carry an optional
**`"blend_profile"`** block (`width_scale` / `noise_scale` / `noise_cell_scale`) scaling the flat↔flat seams
**it** is on, for a texture too far from its neighbours in tone+hue for the global ecotone (shipped on the
NavigableRiver bank only; neutral and bit-exact everywhere else — see Edge Blending → per-terrain
`blend_profile`). The top-level `blend_*` keys are the
**seam** levers, tuned for LAND (`blend_width` = the ecotone's reach, `blend_soft` = the feather
softness, `blend_height_influence` = the detail-following nudge, `blend_noise_scale`/`blend_noise_amount`
= the boundary wobble); the `water_blend` block **overrides width/soft/noise_amount for water↔water
only** (smooth low-variance water needs a wider, softer, wobblier seam). All documented under Edge
Blending below. `feature_noise_cell` is the value-noise cell size
(**raw px**) for the **other** noise-driven features — the shoreline reach/wisp, the canopy treeline and
the peak footline. The blend noise and the feature noise are deliberately **decoupled** (one uniform each)
so retuning the seam can never move a coastline, treeline or footline. **The units differ on purpose:**
`blend_noise_scale` is a **fraction of the hex radius** (→ `blend_noise_cell = blend_noise_scale · radius`
px) so the seam's character is identical at every zoom (a fixed px cell drifted — a hex is ~45px on screen
in-game but several times that in a zoomed-in preview frame, so the same 6px cell read very differently in
the game than in the preview it was judged in), while the shore/treeline/footline look is tuned in
absolute pixels. **Judge any blend change at the GAME's hex radius (~45px)** — use
`tools/blend_probe.tscn`, which pins it.

### Texture Loading (TerrainTextureManager)
- Autoload singleton loads textures once at startup for the 2D map renderer
- Builds `Texture2DArray` from individual PNGs in `textures/base/`
- Exposes: `terrain_textures` (Texture2DArray), `terrain_config`, `use_terrain_textures`, `use_edge_blending`
- Also computes each base layer's **mean luminance** at build time (`layer_mean_luma` /
  `get_layer_mean_luma()`, measured on a 16² Lanczos downscale of the retained CPU-side Image) and packs it
  into `layer_luma_texture` (a 1×N single-channel `ImageTexture`, one texel per terrain id). This is the
  zero-point of each texture's pseudo-height for the shader's flat↔flat **height blending** (see Edge
  Blending); MapView binds it once as the `layer_luma_map` uniform. The Rec.709 weights here MUST match the
  shader's `luma()` helper
- Also builds `canopy_textures` (a second Texture2DArray of RGBA crowns from `textures/canopy/`) +
  `canopy_layer_by_id` / `canopy_layer_for(id)` (`terrain_id → canopy array layer`, -1 = none) for the
  blend shader's canopy overlay (see Edge Blending → Canopy overlay), and `peak_textures` (a third
  Texture2DArray of RGBA mountain relief from `textures/peaks/`) + `peak_layer_by_id` / `peak_layer_for(id)`
  for the blend shader's peak overlay (see Edge Blending → Peak overlay), and `river_textures` (a FOURTH
  Texture2DArray of flowing water from `textures/rivers/`) for the blend shader's river pass (see Edge
  Blending → Rivers). The river array is the one array **not** keyed by terrain id — a river is not a
  biome, it rides an edge — so its layer is the file's numeric prefix = river **class - 1**, and there is
  no `river_layer_for(id)`

### 2D Rendering Pipeline
- `MapView` gets textures from `TerrainTextureManager` and pre-renders hex-masked textures on startup
- Cached as `ImageTexture` per terrain ID for efficient drawing
- Falls back to solid colors when overlay mode is active
- Textures only displayed in base view (empty overlay key)
- Fog of War keeps textures: the draw loop classifies each tile once via
  `_visibility_state_at()` — Active tiles draw full-brightness, Discovered tiles
  are tinted toward the mist color (cloudy) via `_fow_texture_tint_for_state()`,
  Unexplored tiles fill with the fog color.
- Runtime toggle: `T` key (`enable_terrain_textures` / `_toggle_terrain_textures`)
- Edge blending: a flat↔flat **per-pixel biome blend shader** at biome seams (see Edge Blending below)

### Edge Blending — per-pixel biome-blend shader (Approach B)
When `use_edge_blending` is enabled, biome **seams** blend per-pixel in a **fragment shader**
(`assets/terrain/terrain_blend.gdshader`): a symmetric **height blend** (texture splatting) where the two
biomes interlock across the boundary — each texture competes on its own per-pixel height, so one settles
into the *cracks* of the other. It is neither a gradient blur (blur ghosts on detailed textures) nor a
dither (see below). It is deliberately narrow in scope: a biome blends only against biomes of its **own
blend_class**, and only the *flat* and *water* classes blend at all; every other seam — rugged, and every
class change (notably the land↔water shoreline) — stays a **crisp hard edge**. Approach B replaced the earlier baked-overlay
dither (Approach A), fixing its three caveats: **symmetric** mutual intrusion (a tie at the exact edge via
signed distance), **no tiling** (world-space noise varies per hex), and **cleaner grain**.

**Eligibility — SAME CLASS (`blend_class`, config `terrain_config.json`):** every terrain carries a
`blend_class` of `flat` | `water` | `rugged` (id-map G channel: 0 water / 1 flat / 2 rugged, named
`CLASS_WATER`/`CLASS_FLAT`/`CLASS_RUGGED` in the shader). Blend fires for an edge **only** when both
sides share the **same blendable class** and their terrain ids differ:
- **flat↔flat** (grass↔soil ecotones) → blends.
- **water↔water** (deep_ocean ↔ continental_shelf ↔ inland_sea …) → **blends**. Two adjacent ocean
  depths are a gradient, not a cliff; before this rule the `water` class forbade *all* water blending
  and deep-vs-shelf showed razor-sharp hexagon silhouettes.
- **land↔water** (a CLASS CHANGE) → **hard**. That seam is the **shoreline**, owned by the foam/beach
  pass; softening it would wash the coastline out. This is the whole reason `water` is its own class —
  but the old gate over-reached and also banned water↔water.
- **rugged↔anything** → hard (forests/hills/mountains/volcanic — never bleed discrete-object textures),
  **unless `blend_rugged_land` is on** — see below.

`MapView._terrain_is_flat` / `_blend_class_code` read a cached `_terrain_blend_class` map
(`_build_terrain_blend_class_map`); `TerrainTextureManager.blend_class_for` mirrors it.

**`blend_rugged_land` — the RUGGED-LAND gate (config bool, `terrain_config.json`, **SHIPPED `true`**;
`EDGE_BLEND_DEFAULT_RUGGED_LAND` in `MapView.gd` → the shader's `blend_rugged_land` uniform).** Under
the bare same-class rule a rugged biome's BASE FLOOR never blends, so it ends in a razor-straight
hexagon against its neighbour — and for a **peak** biome that floor is the *whole* ground under the
relief overlay (`rolling_hills`' base is plain grass; the mounds are a `peaks/` overlay), which is the
"rolling hills look CUT OFF at the hex edge" report. This gate widens the **land** half of the rule from
*same class* to *both sides are land*: flat↔rugged and rugged↔rugged blend through the **existing** flat
levers (no new tuning), so a hills/alpine hex feathers into its neighbour instead of cookie-cutting.
**land↔water is untouched** (still hard — that seam is the shoreline) and water keeps its depth field,
so it is **bit-identical** on every frame with no rugged hex (verified: `blend_bands_full`,
`blend_isolated_shipped`, `V7_coast_unchanged` and `V10_shore_dark_land_closeup` all byte-compare equal
with it on).
It shipped only after the **whole rugged roster** was swept for SHREDDING (the height term tearing holes
in a structured texture's interior — high-contrast rugged art is exactly what is at risk): **`blend_probe`
state R** renders EVERY rugged biome as an **ISOLATED hex surrounded by a contrasting one**, in a flat
field *and* in a rugged field, gate OFF vs ON. All held — interiors stay solid, only the rim feathers,
including the extreme-contrast cases (white `fumarole_basin` on dark rocky_reg; black `basaltic_lava_field`
and white `karst_highland` on orange `canyon_badlands`). **A straight band seam cannot show shredding —
never judge this gate on one.** What it *does* cost is that a high-contrast rugged pair (bright karst
against orange canyon) now reads as a wide hazy ecotone rather than crisp geology; that is a look call,
not a tear.

**WATER IS A DEPTH FIELD, NOT A SEAM** (the fix for the "dark patches of open water with hard
full-hexagon edges, FoW off" report). A hex's water id is a **quantized sample of a continuous seafloor**,
and the real map's ocean is **salt-and-pepper**, not clean blobs: a live 80×52 snapshot's id-map carried
**2332 deep_ocean↔continental_shelf hex adjacencies** and **16 deep hexes whose six water neighbours were all
a different id**. Under the flat↔flat *nearest-edge* seam blend such a hex can only ever read as a **dark
hexagon** — the rim feathers, but the interior keeps the (far darker) deep texture and the silhouette IS the
hex. That artifact is **TERRAIN, not the FoW tint**: with FoW off the shader never reads the vis-map at all
(`fow_enabled` gates the whole block) and `_rebuild_terrain_shader_maps` writes vis = 255 everywhere, so
**fog off already means every hex renders fully lit** — no mist, no dim, nowhere in the client (the CPU path's
`_visibility_state_at` returns `""` → `Color.WHITE`, and the overlay-color path is `_fow_enabled`-gated too).
So water takes its **own branch**: every qualifying water neighbour (same class, different id) contributes
**at once**, weighted by how close the fragment is to **that** shared edge — the same 6-neighbour cross-edge
weighting the FoW softening uses — and the result is the **normalized weighted mean** of the water textures.
The weight reaches 1 exactly **at** a shared edge, so the mean there is `(own + nb)/2` read from BOTH sides:
continuous across every boundary by construction. The flat↔flat interlock is **untouched** and water no longer
takes it. Verify with `blend_probe` **state 9 (X)** below.

**The three water levers** (`terrain_config.json` → `water_blend` block:
`blend_width` **0.45** / `blend_soft` **0.45** / `blend_noise_amount` **0.45**, vs the land
0.25/0.35/0.30; fallbacks are `WATER_BLEND_DEFAULT_*` in `MapView.gd`, pushed as the
`water_blend_band`/`water_blend_soft`/`water_blend_noise_amount` uniforms). They keep their names but, under
the depth field, they mean:
- `blend_width` → the field's **REACH**: how far into the own hex a neighbour's depth still bleeds.
- `blend_soft` → the **PLATEAU**, as a fraction of that reach: how far back from the shared edge a neighbour
  already carries FULL weight. **This is the lever that dissolves the hexagon** (a pure ramp only softens its
  rim). Capped in-shader by `WATER_FIELD_PLATEAU_MAX` (0.5) so a ramp always survives — a plateau spanning the
  whole reach would put a hard step at the reach's outer edge.
- `blend_noise_amount` → the amplitude of the world-noise displacement of the depth boundary (in reach units),
  so the depth contour meanders organically instead of tracing hex geometry. Sampled in map space, so a world
  point reads the same value from both sides of an edge — continuity survives it.

The wobble **cell** (`blend_noise_scale`) and the height nudge stay **shared with land** — a finer cell would
speckle, and the height term is a no-op on smooth low-variance water anyway.

**Mechanism — whole-map shader quad + hex splatmap:**
- `terrain_blend.gdshader` (canvas_item) is drawn as **one whole-map rect** by a dedicated child
  node `TerrainBlendQuad` (`show_behind_parent = true`, so it renders BEHIND MapView's grid/markers —
  a separate node is required because a canvas item's ShaderMaterial applies to *all* its draw
  commands). `MapView._setup_terrain_blend_shader` builds it once; `_update_terrain_shader_quad`
  pushes uniforms each frame. Per fragment the shader **inverts the pointy-top odd-r hex layout**
  (MUST match `MapView._hex_center`/`_axial_center`/`_offset_to_axial` + the `hex_origin`/`hex_radius`
  uniforms exactly — this is the alignment contract with grid lines/selection/markers), reads its
  hex's biome from the **`sampler2DArray`**, and — if its class is blendable (flat or water) — checks the
  6 neighbours (wrap-aware) for a **same-class, different-id** biome; near the nearest qualifying shared
  edge it **height-blends** the neighbour's
  array sample in. The seam weight is **symmetric**: `p = clamp(0.5 + signed_dist_to_edge /
  (2·blend_band), 0, 1)` is 0.5 at the edge on both sides.
- **THE INVARIANT: the seam is ALWAYS a continuous weighted mix, never a 1-bit pick.** The splat weight
  `p` **leads**; two enveloped perturbations only **bend** it; a `smoothstep` feathers the result into a
  mix factor:
  ```glsl
  float env = 4.0 * p * (1.0 - p);                          // dies at both ends of the band
  float h   = (luma(own) - mean_luma(own_layer)) - (luma(nb) - mean_luma(nb_layer));
  float pw  = clamp(p + ((noise - 0.5) * blend_noise_amount - h * blend_height_influence) * env, 0.0, 1.0);
  result    = mix(own, nb, smoothstep(0.5 - blend_soft, 0.5 + blend_soft, pw));
  ```
  The **wobble** (world `vnoise`, cell `blend_noise_cell`) gives an organic, meandering boundary instead
  of the straight hex line, and carries **low-variance pairs** (smooth sand ↔ smooth soil) where there is
  little detail to follow. The **height term** is a *detail-following NUDGE*: with no height maps each
  texture's **zero-centred luminance** is its pseudo-height (`luma(rgb) − mean_luma(layer)`, Rec.709; the
  per-layer means come from `TerrainTextureManager.layer_luma_texture`, a 1×N single-channel texture
  fetched by layer index — **zero-centring is essential**, or a bright biome always out-heights a dark one
  and the seam collapses to one side), and it bends the boundary toward the darker/lighter side so it
  follows the textures' own tufts and grains. `blend_height_influence` **must stay small** (≤
  `EDGE_BLEND_MAX_HEIGHT_INFLUENCE` = 0.5) so it can never out-vote the distance weight. The `4·p·(1−p)`
  envelope guarantees no perturbation can leak neighbour texture into a hex interior nor leave a straight
  discontinuity at the band's outer edge.
- **Rejected alternatives (do NOT reintroduce)** — the first two are the SAME BUG (a 1-bit pick) in two
  disguises: (1) the **dither** (`result = neighbour if p > vnoise(...)`) — a binary pick makes every pixel
  100% one biome, so the seam can only ever be **discrete hard-edged blobs**; the user's verdict on the live
  game was "the blobs are too big… I shouldn't really even notice the blending, but it is very obvious". No
  noise tuning fixes it (coarse noise → chunky blobs, fine noise → pixel shimmer) — *the approach was the
  bug*. (1b) **Height blending with `blend_height_influence` 4.0 + a small overlap depth** (`blend_depth`,
  now gone): the luma term (±0.3 × 4 = ±1.2) **dwarfed** the 0..1 distance weight, so it degenerated into
  winner-takes-all-by-luminance — wherever prairie was dark, soil won outright, *deep inside the hex*. The
  user's verdict: prairie hexes looked **shredded**, "this isn't a blend at all". A straight band seam looks
  fine under this bug — **only an isolated hex surrounded by the other biome exposes it**, which is exactly
  what `blend_probe`'s isolated-hex state renders. (2) A plain
  linear crossfade — it ghosts two detailed textures over each other. (3) A 3-octave "wander" noise +
  an S-curve on `p` (tried under the dither) — big smooth lobes.
- **Base biome UV — CONTINUOUS world space** (like the canopy pass, NOT per-hex-normalized): the base
  biome is sampled at `base_uv = v_map / (2·hex_radius) · base_scale` (`v_map = v_world - hex_origin`,
  pan/zoom-anchored), so **one texture tile spans ~`1/base_scale` hex-rows** and adjacent hexes show
  DIFFERENT regions of it. This kills the **per-hex identical-repeat grid** (with diagonal seams) that
  any *detailed* (non-homogeneous) base texture used to show when each hex was mapped to one whole
  centered copy — invisible on homogeneous grass/water, obvious on a rocky/alpine texture. The
  **flat↔flat height blend samples the neighbour biome at the SAME `base_uv`** (only the array layer differs),
  so the cross-edge interlock stays continuous (two world-sampled biomes at one world point). `repeat_enable`
  tiles the array. The canopy pass already sampled this way; the base now matches it.
- **id-map splatmap** (`_rebuild_terrain_shader_maps`, per snapshot): a `grid_w × grid_h` **RGBA8**
  texture, R = terrain id, G = `blend_class` code (0 water / 1 flat / 2 rugged), B = canopy code
  (0 none, else canopy layer + 1), A = 255, NEAREST-sampled. A
  companion **R8 vis-map** carries FoW state (0 unexplored / 0.5 discovered / 1 active).
- **Config levers (all fallbacks mirrored as `EDGE_BLEND_DEFAULT_*` consts in `MapView.gd`):**
  - `blend_width` (**0.25** → `blend_band = blend_width · radius`, the half-band in px) — the **REACH**, i.e.
    the width of the ecotone. The user wants a **shallow** transition confined to the hex edge, so it is
    small: `0.25·radius` ≈ 19px at the on-screen r≈75, a band that never reaches a hex interior.
  - `blend_soft` (**0.35**, capped at `EDGE_BLEND_MAX_SOFT` = 0.5) — the **FEATHER SOFTNESS**: the
    smoothstep's half-width in seam-weight units. **Small** (≈0.03) ⇒ the mix snaps wherever the
    noise/detail carries the weight past 0.5 → a fine crisp **stipple**; **large** (≈0.35) ⇒ a smooth
    **gradient** the noise only leans. Floored in-shader (`BLEND_SOFT_MIN`) so it can never become a hard step.
  - `blend_height_influence` (**0.25**, hard-capped at `EDGE_BLEND_MAX_HEIGHT_INFLUENCE` = 0.5) — the
    detail-following **NUDGE** (see the invariant above). Typical zero-centred luma deviations are ±0.3, so
    0.25 moves the weight by ≤ ~0.08 — a fraction of the 0..1 distance weight it perturbs. `0` = a pure
    distance+noise feather. **Never raise it past the cap**: at 4.0 it out-voted the distance weight and
    shredded hex interiors (see Rejected alternatives).
  - `blend_noise_scale` (**0.25**, a **fraction of the hex radius** → the `blend_noise_cell` px uniform) —
    the **WAVELENGTH** of the boundary wobble: ≈19px at r=75, i.e. a few organic lobes per hex edge, which
    is what stops the seam reading as the straight hex polyline. Very fine (≈0.05) turns it into a
    per-pixel speckle instead (which only reads as a boundary at all when `blend_soft` is also tiny).
  - `blend_noise_amount` (**0.3**) — the wobble's amplitude, **added to** the seam weight (never
    thresholded against it — this is not a dither) and enveloped so it dies at both ends of the band.
  - `blend_rugged_land` (**true**, shipped) — the rugged-land eligibility gate (see the gate above). It
    changes only *which* seams blend, never *how*: rugged land reuses the five levers above verbatim.
  - **PER-TERRAIN `blend_profile` — because ONE ecotone does not fit every PAIR.** The five levers above are
    the GLOBAL ecotone, and they are tuned for the biome pairs that actually border each other: neighbours a
    few brightness points apart that share a hue. Their visible ramp is only ~`0.35·r` wide and the wobble
    displaces it by a fraction of that, so the boundary still essentially **traces the hex polyline** — which
    is invisible between two tan grasslands and *glaring* between two textures far apart in **both tone and
    hue**. The `NavigableRiver` **bank** (id 37) is exactly that: grey, low-contrast gravel (mean luma **89**)
    whose neighbours in a river corridor are prairie/scrub (**112–127**) on one side and floodplain/alluvial
    (**55–58**) on the other. Under the global levers alone the corridor renders as a **chain of grey
    hexagons** — the blend fires correctly, it is simply far too narrow and too straight to read as an
    ecotone at that contrast. **This is NOT fixable with the global levers** (widening them to suit the bank
    would move every biome seam main tuned), so a terrain entry may carry an optional block scaling the seams
    **it** is on, along three axes — the flat↔flat twin of the water side's `shore_profile`:
    `{ "id": 37, …, "blend_profile": { "width_scale": 2.6, "noise_scale": 2.2, "noise_cell_scale": 2.6 } }`
    * `width_scale` multiplies `blend_band` — the ecotone's **REACH**.
    * `noise_scale` multiplies `blend_noise_amount` — the boundary wobble's **AMPLITUDE**, so the boundary
      leaves the hexagon instead of tracing it.
    * `noise_cell_scale` multiplies `blend_noise_cell` — the wobble's **WAVELENGTH**. **Amplitude without
      wavelength is a fine fringe on a straight line**, not a meander: the lobes must scale with the (now
      wider) band. The two noise axes move together.
    * **CROSS-EDGE AGREEMENT — an edge takes the per-axis `max()` of its two terrains' profiles.** `max` is
      **commutative**, so both hexes flanking a seam derive the *identical* band, amplitude and cell; `p` is
      0.5 at the edge from both frames and the mix stays continuous across it, exactly as under the global
      levers. This is the same discipline that makes `shore_profile` key on the **water** side — if the two
      sides disagreed, the profile would itself draw the hard line it exists to remove.
    * **A terrain with no `blend_profile` is neutral (1, 1, 1) → a BIT-EXACT no-op**, and a seam between two
      unprofiled terrains is `max(1,1) = 1` on every axis. Verified: with only the bank profiled, **239 of
      247** harness frames are **byte-identical** to before it landed — the 8 that move are exactly the 8
      `map_rivers*` frames (i.e. every frame containing a navigable hex, and nothing else). Every
      `blend_bands_*` / `blend_isolated_*` / `V7_*` / `V10_*` / `H_*` / `R_*` / `S_*` / `G_*` / `D*` / `W_*`
      frame and `map_biome_blend` / `map_biome_shore_seam` / `map_swatch` are untouched.
    * Plumbing **mirrors `layer_shore_texture` exactly**: `TerrainTextureManager` packs the profiles into
      `layer_blend_texture` (1×N `FORMAT_RGBAF`, R = width_scale, G = noise_scale, B = noise_cell_scale),
      bound once by MapView as the `layer_blend_map` uniform and fetched in-shader by layer index
      (`blend_profile(layer)` → `vec3`; `edge_blend_profile()` is the `max` over the pair).
      `rebuild_layer_blend_map()` is public and updates the ImageTexture **in place** (so the binding
      survives) — that is how `blend_probe` state **17 (BANK)** sweeps it. Fallbacks are the
      `BLEND_PROFILE_DEFAULT_*` consts; `BLEND_PROFILE_MAX_SCALE` (4.0) guard-rails the reach, since the
      apothem is only 0.866·r and a wider band would collide with the opposite seam.
    * **Shipped:** only `navigable_river` (2.6 / 2.2 / 2.6) — chosen on `blend_probe` state 17, which renders
      the corridor against a **dark** field and a **bright** one in ONE frame. `1.8/1.6/2.0` still traced the
      hexagon; `3.4/2.8/3.2` started dissolving the bank's identity as a distinct silty corridor. Judge any
      new profile there, **including the isolated-hex shred crops** — a corridor seam cannot show a torn
      interior.
  - The blend look is **zoom-invariant** (band + wobble are both radius-relative), so a preview frame is an
    honest proxy for the game *only if it is rendered at the game's on-screen hex radius* (**r ≈ 75px**;
    hexes read ~150px across on the user's screen). `tools/blend_probe.tscn` pins that, and — critically —
    renders **isolated hexes surrounded by another biome**, the only state that exposes hex shredding.
    `tools/map_preview.gd` *fits* (r ≈ 83–178) and only ever shows straight band seams, so judgements made
    in it are not trustworthy for the blend.
  - `feature_noise_cell` (default `6.0`, the world-noise cell **px** for the
    shoreline reach/wisp + canopy treeline + peak footline; **decoupled** from the blend noise — it
    drives the shader's `noise_cell` uniform, so the seam can be retuned without moving any
    coastline/treeline/footline; verified by pixel-diff).
  - Top-level `base_texture_scale`
  (→ `base_scale`, default `0.25` = one base texture spans ~4 hex-rows; smaller covers MORE hexes,
  larger fewer — `BASE_DEFAULT_TEXTURE_SCALE` in `MapView.gd`). **LOD:** below `EDGE_BLEND_MIN_RADIUS`
  (`= ICON_MIN_DETAIL_RADIUS`) the shader renders base-only (no shimmer at far zoom). **FoW:** the
  shader applies the same discovered-mist multiply / unexplored-fog fill as the per-hex path
  (`_fow_texture_tint_for_state` semantics) via the vis-map — it dims, never drops, the blend. It also
  **softens the mist across hex boundaries** — see Fog-of-war softening below.

**Fog-of-war softening — the hex steps (shader path only).** The vis-map is **per-hex, NEAREST-sampled**
(0 unexplored / 0.5 discovered / 1 active), so reading it raw made every **active↔discovered adjacency a
hard HEXAGONAL brightness step** — straight edges cutting across even *uniform water*, where no terrain
seam exists at all. (This is why "hard straight edges are back" reports must be checked against
`blend_probe` state 5 *before* the blend is touched: the culprit was usually the FoW tint, not the blend.)
Fixed in two halves, both in the shader's `fow_enabled` block:
1. **Smooth the visibility SCALAR across hex boundaries**, reusing the same 6-neighbour
   signed-distance machinery as the blend/shore: each neighbour's visibility is weighted by
   `smoothstep(-fow_soft, 0, d)` — how close the fragment is to **that** shared edge — and the weighted
   mean replaces the raw per-hex value. At a shared edge the neighbour's weight → 1, so `vis → (own+nb)/2`
   from **both** sides — equal, hence **continuous across the boundary**; deep inside a hex all six weights
   → 0 and `vis → own`, so interiors are untouched.
2. **Map `vis` to the tint CONTINUOUSLY** (the old per-state `if` chain was itself a step function):
   `fog_amt = 1 − smoothstep(FOW_UNEXPLORED, FOW_DISCOVERED, vis)` and
   `mist_amt = (1 − smoothstep(FOW_DISCOVERED, FOW_ACTIVE, vis)) · mist_blend`, composited with the
   **existing** `mist_color`/`fog_color`/`mist_blend` uniforms. At the pure states this reproduces today's
   look **exactly** (verified bit-identical: vis 1 = clear, 0.5 = the same mist multiply, 0 = fog fill) —
   only the boundaries change.
- **Optional wispiness:** the smoothed scalar is perturbed by world `vnoise` (reusing `noise_cell`) so the
  fog line reads cloudy rather than a clean arc. It is **enveloped by `|smoothed − own|`** (normalized by
  `FOW_NOISE_EDGE_PEAK`, the 0.25 that a 6-neighbour average can shift the scalar across one state gap), so
  it bites **only at boundaries** and can never tint a pure Active/Discovered/Unexplored interior.
- **Config levers** (`heightfield_config.json` → `fog_of_war`, beside the existing mist/fog colours —
  FoW appearance stays in one place): `fow_softness` (**0.6**, a **fraction of the hex radius** → the
  `fow_soft` px uniform, like `blend_width`, so the gradient is zoom-invariant) and `fow_noise_amount`
  (**0.15**; `0` disables the wisps). Fallbacks are `FOW_DEFAULT_SOFTNESS` / `FOW_DEFAULT_NOISE_AMOUNT` in
  `MapView.gd`. The **per-hex CPU path is unaffected** (it is hard-edged by construction).
- **Verify** with `blend_probe` state 5 → `V8_water_fow_on.png`: on uniform shelf water the mist boundary
  must read as a soft cloudy gradient with **no hexagonal brightness steps**, while pure Active and pure
  Discovered areas are unchanged. State **8 (W)** makes the before/after explicit —
  `W_fow_on_same_terrain.png` (softness `0` = the unsmoothed tint) vs `W_fow_fixed_same_terrain.png`, on two
  adjacent **shelf** hexes across an Active/Discovered boundary. **This is the FIRST thing to render on any
  "hard straight full-hexagon edges are back in open water" report**: the tone-only steps in water are the
  FoW tint, NOT the blend (which `W_fow_off.png` shows already dissolving the deep-ocean silhouette). The
  mist multiply lands exactly on the hex boundary, so it **re-imposes a hard hexagonal edge on water the
  blend has just softened** — and it does so between hexes of the SAME terrain id, where no seam exists.
- **Integration:** the shader is the base-terrain renderer whenever `use_terrain_textures` and no
  overlay and `use_edge_blending` (`_shader_terrain_active`); it **bypasses the CPU map cache** (a
  single cheap GPU draw, so the cache's per-hex-loop purpose is moot). With `use_edge_blending` off,
  the **per-hex texture path** (`_build_hex_texture_cache` / `_draw_hex_textured_direct` +
  `CachedMapRenderer`) renders crisp hard hexes — that is the blend-OFF reference. Overlay/solid
  modes are unchanged.

**Shoreline — ONE continuous coastal profile straddling the coast (universal for now):** separate from the
flat↔flat interlock, every **land↔water** edge gets a coastal treatment in the same shader, reusing the
signed-distance-to-shared-edge machinery. It fires for any edge where **exactly one side is water**
(`blend_class` code 0) — so it's independent of the land side's class (**both flat-land and rugged-land**
coasts get it) and never touches inland edges (flat↔flat interlock and rugged↔* inland edges stay exactly
as before — both sides non-water → skipped). **The one exception is a `NavigableRiver` hex, whose edges are
excluded from the pass entirely — a river meeting the sea is not a coast; see Rivers → NavigableRiver for why
it cannot be expressed as a `shore_profile`.** Seaward read: **land → sand → surf → open water**, and the
requirement is that **NO boundary in that chain is a hard line** — not sand↔land, not sand↔foam, not
foam↔water.
- **THE SIGNED COAST COORDINATE `u` — why this can't step at the hex edge.** The shore pass computes
  `dist_in` = distance from the shared land↔water edge INTO the own hex, which tends to **0 on BOTH sides**
  at that edge. Negating it on the land side gives one coordinate running continuously through the
  coastline: `u < 0` inland · `u = 0` **exactly at the waterline** · `u > 0` seaward. Every shore weight is
  a `smoothstep` **of `u` alone**, so its value at `u = 0` is identical whether the fragment belongs to the
  land hex or the water hex — the profile is continuous across the boundary **by construction**, and no
  term can pop there. (The world-noise wobble that meanders the reaches is sampled in **map space**, so it
  too is the same value on both sides of the edge at a given world point.)
- **The three rejected passes — all the same bug class** (a term saturating AT the hex edge, or sand where
  the user does not want it). (1) A **two-sided** pass (tan beach on the land, foam on the water) with
  LINEAR fades `1 − dist_in/reach`, which are **≈1 AT the shared edge on BOTH sides**: the land went solid
  tan, the water solid white, and they met along the boundary — a **hard tan↔white line TRACING THE
  HEXAGON**. (2) The fix for *that* pushed everything onto the **water side** (`land_beach_width = 0`),
  which killed the sand↔foam line but left the sand **stopping dead at the hex edge against the raw land
  texture** — a **new hard sand↔land line**. (3) Sand on **BOTH** sides (`sand_land_band` + `sand_sea_band`)
  straddling the edge: every hard line was gone, but the beach then read **TWICE AS WIDE** — **sand in the
  water hex is not wanted at all**. Hence the shipped shape: sand is **LAND-ONLY**, and the sand↔foam blend
  is bought by letting the **surf wash INLAND over the beach** instead of by putting sand in the sea.
- **Sand — LAND SIDE ONLY** (`u ≤ 0`; the water hex gets **zero** sand, by construction — the term is
  ternary-gated on the sign of `u`). It is **FULL from the waterline across the surf's inland wash** (the
  **plateau**), then `smoothstep`-fades inland into the biome art over the rest of `sand_band`. Capped at
  `SHORE_SAND_OPACITY` (< 1) so the land art reads through and the beach never looks like flat paint, and
  its reach is deliberately SHORT (0.25·r) so it tints rather than buries the biome.
  **The plateau is anchored to `foam_inland_band`, and that anchor is load-bearing** (`SHORE_SAND_PLATEAU_MAX`
  caps it at 0.6 of the sand reach, so a fade window always survives): the surf is composited **over** the
  sand and peaks at ~1 at the waterline, so wherever the wash is strong the sand is whitewashed and
  contributes nothing. A sand that *also* decayed from the waterline (a plain `1 − smoothstep(0, sand_reach,
  −u)`) was down to ~30% opacity by the time the foam cleared and gone entirely a hair further inland — the
  beach was **invisible** and the coast read **land → surf → water with NO SAND AT ALL** (caught against a
  dark rocky-regolith coast, where white foam met bare rock; **prairie's tan hides this** — always judge the
  beach on a DARK land biome). Holding the sand full across the wash means the **retreating surf uncovers a
  full-strength beach** — that IS the sand↔foam crossfade.
- **THE WATERLINE BASE CROSS-FADE (`waterline_width`) — the last hard seam in the shader, and the reason the
  surf no longer has to be opaque.** Until this existed the **base texture itself stepped at `u = 0`**: on a
  beach coast the (sand-tinted) land met open water with nothing in between; on a **cliff** coast
  (`deep_ocean`, `sand_scale` 0) it was **raw land meeting raw water**. The full-strength foam peak was the
  ONLY thing papering over that flip — which is why **every previous attempt to "just soften the foam"
  re-exposed a hard land↔water line and had to be reverted** (four times). So the base now cross-fades across
  a short reach either side of the coastline: `mixed = mix(land_base, water_base, smoothstep(-w, w, u))`,
  held at full across `±w` and handing back to the true base over `SHORE_WATERLINE_FADE` beyond it.
  * **`land_base` / `water_base` are the SAME weighted-mean-over-{own + 6 neighbours} construction as the
    shore-profile field** (weight `smoothstep(−apothem, 0, d)`, unwobbled, own = 1) — so both are pure
    functions of the **id-map and the world UV**, never of `result` (which carries the own hex's
    interlock/depth-field history). The land hex and the water hex therefore compute the **same pair** at a
    given world point, `mixed` is frame-independent, and at `u = 0` both sides land on it **exactly**:
    continuous across the hex boundary by construction, like every other shore term. See
    `SHORE_PROFILE_REACH_APOTHEMS` for why that mean is exactly continuous.
  * **It is a WET EDGE, not an ecotone.** `waterline_width` **0.14** (·r) sits well under the sand's 0.25, so
    no land texture reads out to sea and no water texture reads up the beach. **Chosen on the foam-off step
    check** (`blend_probe` state **SURF**, cliff coast — the worst case, no sand out there either): 0.08
    already dissolves the step, **0.14** reads as a natural wet-rock rim, 0.20 starts **ghosting land pebbles
    into the water**. `0` disables it bit-exactly (and then `foam_opacity` must go back to 1).
  * **DO NOT envelope it with a ramp that also peaks at `u = 0`.** The first cut multiplied the cross-fade by
    `1 − smoothstep(0, w, |u|)` — two ramps peaking at the waterline — so the water content on the land side
    was already down to **8% at half the reach**: the visible gradient was a **quarter** of the configured one
    (~4px) and **the base step survived**. Hence `SHORE_WATERLINE_FADE`: full weight across the reach, fade
    back to the true base outside it.
- **Surf — peaks AT the waterline and washes BOTH ways.** Inland over the sand across `foam_inland_band`
  (the crossfade that kills the sand↔foam line) and seaward into open water across `foam_band`. **Its peak is
  the `foam_opacity` lever (shipped 0.55)** — and it is a lever *only because the waterline cross-fade above
  removed the base step it used to conceal*. With `waterline_width = 0` the peak is load-bearing again and
  `foam_opacity` must go back to ~1. It scales the **wisp** (`SHORE_WISP_STRENGTH`) too, so the whole surf
  mutes as one gesture rather than the peak fading while the offshore froth stays bright. `1.0` is a
  bit-exact no-op. This is what answers the **"obvious bright white outline on most land"** report: with the
  base step gone the surf can be a translucent highlight instead of an opaque cover-up.
- **Wisp — the faint SECOND surf line out over open water.** Its geometry is **its own pair of
  radius-relative levers** (`wisp_center_width` / `wisp_half_width` → the `wisp_center_band` /
  `wisp_half_band` px uniforms), **not** a multiple of `foam_band` as it once was — that chaining meant the
  surf could not be shortened without dragging the wisp in with it (and the wisp could not be pulled in at
  all). Config is responsible for keeping the wisp band **clear of the surf** (`wisp_center − wisp_half >
  foam_width`) so the two read as two lines; overlap just merges them into one wide white smear.
  `wisp_half_width = 0` turns the wisp off. Only its opacity (`SHORE_WISP_STRENGTH`) stays a shader const.
- **Every falloff is a `smoothstep`** (no linear ramp's slope kink, no hard cutoff anywhere). All reaches
  are noise-modulated by the SAME world-noise wobble (`mix(SHORE_REACH_NOISE_MIN, 1, noise)`, reusing
  `noise_cell`), so the sand's inland edge, the surf line and the wisp meander together as organic fingers
  rather than concentric clean stripes.
- **Config levers** (`terrain_config.json` → `shore` block): `sand_width` (**0.25** — sand reach INLAND of
  the coastline; **land-only**) / `foam_inland_width` (**0.15** — how far the surf washes UP the beach) /
  `foam_width` (**0.41** — surf reach SEAWARD) / `wisp_center_width` (**0.55**) / `wisp_half_width`
  (**0.13**) — the second surf line's centre and half-thickness, so it spans 0.42–0.68·r, clear of the surf
  that dies at 0.41·r — and **`waterline_width`** (**0.14** — the base cross-fade's half-reach; see the
  waterline bullet above). **All six are fractions of the hex radius** → the `sand_band` / `foam_inland_band` /
  `foam_band` / `wisp_center_band` / `wisp_half_band` / `waterline_band` px uniforms (computed in
  `MapView._update_terrain_shader_quad` like `blend_width`), plus **`foam_opacity`** (**0.55** — the surf's +
  wisp's peak opacity, a unit scalar) and `foam_color` / `beach_color` (RGB 0–255, parsed by
  `MapView._shore_color` into normalized `vec3` uniforms). **`foam_color` ships MUTED — `[176, 194, 205]`, a
  grey-blue** (it was `[223, 242, 247]`, a near-white that read as a hard bright outline at map-scale zoom);
  the recolour alone was rendered as a candidate ("option A") and rejected — it only greys the ring, it does
  not stop it being an opaque ring, because the ring's opacity was structural. Fallbacks are the
  `SHORE_DEFAULT_*` consts in `MapView.gd`; the fixed feel-tuning (`SHORE_SAND_PLATEAU_MAX` /
  `SHORE_SAND_OPACITY` / `SHORE_WISP_STRENGTH` / `SHORE_WATERLINE_FADE`) is named consts in the shader. The `land_beach_width` / `sand_land_width` / `sand_sea_width` keys of the rejected passes are
  **gone**. Note the visible beach is intrinsically narrow: the surf covers the inner `foam_inland_width` of
  it, so only the `sand_width − foam_inland_width` annulus (0.10·r) reads as open sand — that is the
  specified geometry, not a bug. LOD-suppressed and FoW-tinted like the rest of the shader (shares the
  `blend_enabled` gate + the vis-map).
- **Verify at the game's hex radius** with `tools/blend_probe.tscn` **state 6 (V10)** — the shipped profile
  on the ragged coast at r≈75 → `V10_shore.png` + `V10_shore_closeup.png` **and `V10_shore_dark_land.png` +
  `V10_shore_dark_land_closeup.png`** (the same coast against **rocky_regolith**). **The dark-land frame is
  the decisive one** — prairie is tan and hides sand-vs-land contrast, which masked the invisible-beach bug
  through several passes. **Judge on the close-ups**: the full frame is downscaled when viewed, which hides
  exactly the 1px line this pass exists to prevent. A coast rendered in a *fitted* harness frame is not a
  trustworthy proxy either (the look is radius-relative — same caveat as the blend). `_render_variant` can
  still sweep the three width levers.
- **PER-WATER-TERRAIN shore profile (`shore_profile`) — A COAST IS NOT ONE THING.** The five levers above are
  the GLOBAL profile, tuned for OCEAN coasts. But the worldgen's water sequence is **deep_ocean →
  continental_shelf → land**: deep ocean *never* meets ordinary land, so where it DOES touch land it is a
  **CLIFF** (no beach at all, full dramatic surf), the **shelf** is the ordinary **beach** (sand, a muted
  wave), and an **`inland_sea`** is a handful of hexes that the ocean profile swamps (its offshore **wisp**
  reads as noise across the middle of a lake). So a WATER terrain entry in `terrain_config.json` may carry an
  optional block scaling the profile of **its own** coastline, along **three independent axes**:
  `{ "id": 1, "name": "continental_shelf", …, "shore_profile": { "sand_scale": 1.0, "foam_scale": 0.75, "wisp_scale": 0.5 } }`
  - `sand_scale` multiplies the beach's INLAND reach (`sand_band`). **`0.0` = no beach at all** (the cliff).
  - `foam_scale` multiplies the MAIN WAVE's reaches **both ways** (`foam_inland_band` = the wash up the beach
    **and** `foam_band` = the surf's seaward reach). **REACH only — the surf's PEAK is the GLOBAL
    `foam_opacity` lever**, not a per-water one (see the Surf bullet above). `foam_scale 0` is not a legal
    profile.
  - `wisp_scale` multiplies the secondary offshore disturbance — its **centre distance, its half-width AND its
    strength** — so it recedes toward the shore and fades as one gesture; `0.0` removes it cleanly.
  - **A water terrain with no `shore_profile` gets the neutral default (1, 1, 1)** —
    `SHORE_PROFILE_DEFAULT_{SAND,FOAM,WISP}_SCALE` in `TerrainTextureManager` — a bit-exact no-op (a partial
    block is legal too: a missing key is neutral on that axis).
  - **Plumbing mirrors the per-layer mean-luminance table** (`layer_luma_texture`): `TerrainTextureManager`
    packs the profiles into `layer_shore_texture`, a **1×N FORMAT_RGBAF** image (R = sand_scale, G =
    foam_scale, B = wisp_scale, one texel per terrain id), bound once by MapView as the `layer_shore_map`
    uniform and fetched in-shader by layer index (`shore_profile(layer)` → `vec3`).
    `rebuild_layer_shore_map()` is public and **updates the ImageTexture in place** (so the binding survives)
    — that is how `blend_probe` sweeps profiles live.
  - **THE PROFILE IS KEYED ON THE WATER, on BOTH sides of the waterline.** A *correctness* requirement, not a
    style choice: every shore weight is one smoothstep of the signed coast coordinate `u` evaluated on both
    sides of the shared edge, so if the two sides read different scales the profile would be discontinuous
    **at the hex edge** — reintroducing exactly the hard line `u` exists to prevent. The water is also the only
    side both fragments can agree on (the land biome varies along a coast; the body of water does not) and the
    meaningful one ("cliff, beach or lake?" is a property of the water).
  - **AND IT IS A CONTINUOUS FIELD, NEVER A NEAREST-PICK** (the fix for what used to be filed here as a "known
    limitation"). One land hex can border a deep_ocean hex **AND** a continental_shelf hex along the SAME
    coastline. Taking the *nearest* water neighbour's profile makes the profile **JUMP at the bisector**
    between them — and with `sand_scale` 0 on one side and 1 on the other that is a **HARD LINE of sand
    appearing out of nowhere along the beach** (it was only a faint seam while all the profiles were similar;
    the cliff/beach split makes it glaring). So **every water hex in `{own + 6 neighbours}` contributes at
    once**, weighted by proximity to **that** shared edge, and the profile is their **normalized weighted
    mean** — the water depth field's discipline. A cliff coast **transitions into** a beach coast over ~a hex
    instead of switching.
    * **The weight** is `smoothstep(−reach, 0, d)` on the signed distance `d` to that neighbour's shared edge
      (own water = weight 1 by construction; land contributes nothing — it has no profile), with `reach` =
      `SHORE_PROFILE_REACH_APOTHEMS` (**1.0**) × the hex **apothem** (the `half_dist` the loop already
      computes). It is deliberately **unwobbled** — a noise displacement here would break the cross-edge
      agreement below.
    * **Why 1.0 apothem is the cap, and why the mean is EXACTLY continuous across every hex edge** (including
      the land↔water one, where it must be, per `u` above). On the shared edge of hexes A|B: (i) a water hex
      **C that neighbours BOTH** reads the *same* signed distance from A's frame and from B's frame — the
      three bisectors meeting at that corner are symmetric under the 120° rotation about it — so both frames
      give C the same weight; (ii) a water hex enumerated from **only one** frame has signed distance
      `≤ −apothem` there, so its weight is exactly **0** and the frame that cannot see it agrees. Raising the
      reach past 1.0 apothem breaks (ii) and re-introduces a step at the hex boundary.
    * **The beach fades out with its own reach** (`sand_fade`): `SHORE_REACH_MIN_PX` floors every reach so no
      fade divides by ~0, but on a cliff coast (`sand_scale → 0`) that floor would keep a **1px, full-strength
      tan hairline** alive at the waterline — and worse, the beach would **POP** into existence at full
      opacity the instant `sand_scale` left 0 as a cliff profile blended into a beach one. So the sand's
      opacity is scaled by `min(sand_reach_raw / SHORE_REACH_MIN_PX, 1)`: exactly **1.0 (a bit-exact no-op)
      for any beach wider than the floor**, and a continuous grow-in from nothing below it.
  - **Shipped:** `deep_ocean` **(0, 1, 1)** — the cliff · `continental_shelf` **(1, 0.75, 0.5)** — the ordinary
    beach, main wave muted, disturbance halved · `inland_sea` **(0.5, 0.5, 0)** — the approved lake. Every
    other water terrain (coral_shelf, hydrothermal_vent_field) is neutral. Per-**LAND**-biome shore gating (a
    grassy shore vs a wooded shore) is still deliberately NOT built — all coasts render the same beach+foam
    art. Verify via `tools/map_preview.gd` State Q (`_biome_band_terrain` carves an ocean bay so the ocean
    borders BOTH prairie and woodland) → `map_biome_blend.png` + `map_biome_shore_seam.png` (coast close-up),
    the lake via `blend_probe` **state 10 (L)**, and the cliff/beach/mixed coasts via **state 15 (D)** below.
  - **NOTE for the next pixel-diff:** because the shipped `continental_shelf` profile is no longer neutral,
    `V7_coast_unchanged` / `V10_shore*` / `H_gate_coast` (whose sea IS the shelf) **moved** when it landed —
    that is the shipped muting, not a regression. They remain the bit-identical reference for any blend
    **eligibility** change; re-baseline them after a deliberate `shore_profile` edit. Frames with no ocean hex
    (`blend_bands_*`, every `H_*`/`S_*`/`G_*`, the `L*` lake) must stay byte-identical through both.

**Canopy overlay — forest = grass floor + overhanging tree crowns:** a forest biome is split into a
**ground layer** that blends like any flat land and a **canopy overlay** of whole crowns that overhang
the hex boundary and thin out, so a forest edge is a natural treeline instead of a razor-cut hex
silhouette. Today the only canopy biome is **12 (mixed_woodland)** — its `blend_class` is now **`flat`**
(the grass floor flat↔flat-blends with prairie and gets a shoreline at coasts, like any flat land); 13
(boreal_taiga) stays `rugged` (no canopy asset yet).
- **Assets:** `textures/base/NN_name.png` is the **forest-floor grass** (trees removed);
  `textures/canopy/NN_name.png` (**new dir**, RGBA crowns on transparency) is the canopy.
- **Second Texture2DArray:** `TerrainTextureManager` builds `canopy_textures` (a companion
  `Texture2DArray` from `textures/canopy/`, same once-only `Image.load_from_file` pattern as the base)
  plus `canopy_layer_by_id` (`terrain_id → canopy array layer`, `canopy_layer_for()` returns -1 for
  none). Only biomes with a canopy file get a layer. Two `sampler2DArray`s in **one** canvas shader work
  fine (base `biome_array` + `canopy_tex`).
- **Canopy code in the splatmap:** the id-map is now **RGBA8** (was RG8) — R=terrain id, G=blend_class
  code, **B=canopy code** (`0` none, else canopy layer + 1), A unused (`MapView._canopy_code`). This
  reuses the per-neighbour id-map fetch the shader already does rather than a separate id-indexed uniform
  array, so both own and neighbour canopy state come from one texture read.
- **Overhang density D (shader):** using the same signed-distance-to-shared-edge machinery vs the
  **canopy↔non-canopy** boundary (`s` = signed distance, + inside the forest): D = 1 deep inside, **~0.5
  at the exact edge**, ramping to 1 over `canopy_softness` px inside and down to 0 at `canopy_overhang` px
  **outside** the forest (crowns overhang the neighbour, then fade). The treeline is world-noise
  perturbed (`CANOPY_TREELINE_NOISE`, reusing `noise_cell`) so it's bumpy, not a clean arc. Interior
  forest hexes (all-canopy neighbours) → D=1. Composited **after** blend+shoreline, before FoW:
  `result = mix(result, crown.rgb, crown.a · D)`.
- **Map-space canopy UV:** `cuv = v_map / (2·hex_radius) · canopy_scale`, where `v_map = v_world -
  hex_origin` is the pan/zoom-anchored MAP coordinate (raw `v_world` is the quad-LOCAL/screen-fixed
  coord and would slide against the grid on pan/zoom — all map-space terms, canopy UV + the
  blend-wobble/shore/treeline noise, use `v_map`). Continuous across hexes (a crown straddling a boundary
  reads as one tree). The base biome now samples in the same continuous world space (see **Base biome
  UV** above), so `canopy_scale` and `base_scale` are the two independent world-UV density knobs (a
  crown tile per hex at `canopy_scale = 1.0`; a base tile per ~`1/base_scale` hexes). FoW-tinted like the rest.
- **Canopy LOD is DECOUPLED from the blend LOD** (own `canopy_lod_enabled` uniform, `radius ≥
  canopy_min_radius`, NOT the flat↔flat `blend_enabled`/`EDGE_BLEND_MIN_RADIUS` gate). `canopy_min_radius`
  sits WELL BELOW `EDGE_BLEND_MIN_RADIUS` (3.0 vs 16.0) so the canopy pass keeps running at far zoom:
  interior forest density (D=1) persists into a **distinct darker-green forest mass** (a forest region no
  longer reads as bare grassland when zoomed out); the edge overhang naturally shrinks to nothing as hexes
  shrink. The crown array (`canopy_textures`) is built **with mipmaps** and the `canopy_tex` sampler uses
  **trilinear** (`filter_linear_mipmap`) filtering, so far-zoom crowns AVERAGE into a smooth tone instead of
  shimmering/aliasing. (The base biome array has no mipmaps — `filter_linear` only; the canopy is the layer
  that visibly aliases at far zoom because whole crowns tile many times per tiny hex. If the base ever
  shimmers it can take mipmaps the same way.)
- **Config levers** (`terrain_config.json` → `canopy` block): `overhang_width` / `softness_width`
  (fractions of the hex radius → `canopy_overhang` / `canopy_softness` px uniforms, like `blend_width`),
  `texture_scale` (→ `canopy_scale`), and `canopy_min_radius` (the decoupled canopy LOD floor in px, ≪
  `EDGE_BLEND_MIN_RADIUS`). Fallbacks are the `CANOPY_DEFAULT_*` consts in `MapView.gd`.
- **Caveat — canopy is shader-only:** the blend-OFF **per-hex CPU path** (`use_edge_blending = false`,
  `map_biome_hard.png`) renders only the base, so forests there read as the **bare grass floor** (no
  crowns). The live client runs blend-on, so this affects only the reference/fallback path.
- Verify via `tools/map_preview.gd` State Q → `map_biome_blend.png` + `map_biome_woods_edge_seam.png`
  (the forest block borders prairie floor left + ocean top/right): whole crowns overhang + thin into a
  treeline, interior stays dense, the prairie↔forest floor blends softly, and the forest coast shows
  beach/foam with canopy overhanging the water. Far-zoom decoupled-canopy LOD via State Q-far →
  `map_biome_farzoom.png` (same four bands on a large grid so hexes go tiny): the woodland band reads as a
  distinct darker-green forest mass vs the prairie grass, smooth (mipmapped), not shimmering.

**Peak overlay — highland/volcanic relief = flat rocky floor + overhanging faceted peaks + cast shadow:**
the mountain-drama analog of the canopy overlay, built on the exact same machinery (DRY). A relief biome
keeps its flat rocky base floor and gets an RGBA **peaks overlay** of faceted mountains composited on top:
they overhang the hex boundary and thin to a footline (like the treeline), have an **elevation-driven
prominence**, and **cast a shadow** onto neighbouring hexes, so mountains read as raised relief on the 2D
map. Five relief biomes carry real AI-gen peak art today — **24 (rolling_hills)**, **25 (high_plateau)**,
**26 (alpine_mountain)**, **27 (karst_highland)**, **29 (active_volcano_slope)** — each a magenta-keyed,
offset-blend-seamless RGBA overlay in `textures/peaks/`. (28 canyon_badlands is intentionally NOT a peak
biome — its drama is incision, handled at the base-floor level, not raised relief.)
- **Assets + third Texture2DArray:** `textures/peaks/NN_name.png` (**new dir**, RGBA relief on
  transparency). `TerrainTextureManager` builds `peak_textures` (a THIRD `Texture2DArray`, same once-only
  `Image.load_from_file` + **mipmaps** pattern as the canopy) plus `peak_layer_by_id` /
  `peak_layer_for()` (`terrain_id → peak array layer`, -1 = none). Only biomes with a peak file get a
  layer. Three `sampler2DArray`s in one canvas shader (base + canopy + peaks) work fine.
- **Peak code in the splatmap A channel:** the id-map A channel (previously the unused `255`) now carries
  the **peak code** (`0` none, else peak layer + 1, `MapView._peak_code`) — the peak analog of B=canopy
  code, so both own and neighbour peak state come from the one id-map read the shader already does.
- **New elev-map (R8):** a companion `grid_w × grid_h` R8 texture (parallel to the vis-map), each texel =
  the hex's relative height (`MapView.relative_height_at` 0..100 → 0..255; `PEAK_ELEV_FALLBACK = 200` when
  a snapshot lacks an elevation raster, so relief still renders in preview/rehydrated frames). Drives the
  shader's per-hex `prominence` (`mix(peak_min_prominence, 1, elev)`) and shadow length.
- **Peak pass (shader), after canopy, before FoW:** mirrors the canopy signed-distance-to-boundary scan
  vs the **peak↔non-peak** boundary to get `s` (+inside relief) + `peak_code` (own, else nearest
  peak-neighbour's for the overhang/shadow region). Where `peak_code > 0`: (1) a multi-tap **cast shadow**
  looks back toward `peak_light_dir` (TOWARD the light; top-left = `(-0.7,-0.7)`, canvas +y DOWN) and
  darkens the ground by up to `peak_shadow_strength` where a peak occludes; (2) a **peak composite** over
  the shadowed ground using the shared `canopy_density(s, overhang, softness)` × prominence and the
  world-noise `CANOPY_TREELINE_NOISE` bumpy footline (reused, not duplicated). Peak UV = the same
  continuous map-space `v_map / (2·hex_radius) · peak_scale` as the canopy.
- **PEAK ↔ PEAK IS A SEAM TOO — and the TALLER relief overhangs the LOWER one** (the fix for the "rolling
  hills STILL have hard straight edges, even with `blend_rugged_land` on" report). A peak↔**non**-peak edge is
  a footline (the relief overhangs it and thins away), but an edge between two hexes that BOTH carry relief
  used to be **no boundary at all** — the scan skipped it (`own_is_peak == (ncode > 0) → continue`), so each
  hex composited its OWN peak layer at full density right up to the shared edge and the art switched **1-bit
  ON the hex line**: rolling_hills' green mounds ended in a razor-straight diagonal and alpine_mountain's
  spires began. **The base floor under them was blending correctly the whole time** — it is simply invisible
  under near-opaque relief art, which is why the `blend_rugged_land` gate did not help this seam (`blend_probe`
  state **G** proves it: `G_no_peaks` renders the same seam as a soft organic ecotone).
  So a relief↔relief edge now **cross-fades the two peak layers**, as a CONTINUOUS WEIGHTED MIX (never a pick),
  with the seam's **centre — not its shape — driven by elevation** (the `elev_map` the pass already reads):
  * `asym` = a smooth ODD function of Δelev (`2·smoothstep(−D, D, Δ) − 1`, `D = PEAK_BLEND_FULL_DELTA` = 0.25
    of the 0..1 relative-height scale): +1 when the neighbour towers over us, −1 when we tower over it, **0 at
    equal height**.
  * the 50/50 line sits at depth `m = (peak_overhang − peak_softness) · asym` **into our hex**, and the
    neighbour layer's coverage is `w = 1 − smoothstep(m − peak_softness, m + peak_softness, depth)`. So the
    taller relief spills across the edge and dies exactly `peak_overhang` px in — **the same reach it has onto
    flat ground, and no further** (offsetting by the *full* overhang stacks the feather on top of it and pushes
    the alpine art a whole hex radius into the hills, swallowing them), while the lower relief does **not climb
    uphill**. At Δelev → 0 it degrades to `m = 0`: a symmetric cross-fade of half-width `peak_softness`.
  * **CONTINUITY** (the shoreline's signed-coast-coordinate discipline): the neighbour computes the same edge
    with `asym`, hence `m`, **negated**, and smoothstep is symmetric about its centre — so at the shared edge
    (depth = 0 from **both** sides) the two hexes assign the **same** coverage to the **same** layer, for every
    elevation pair. The seam-centre **wobble** (world noise, so the cross-fade meanders instead of tracing the
    straight hex line) must therefore be applied **ANTISYMMETRICALLY**, signed by the peak **layer index** — a
    total order both sides agree on and that never ties.
  * Neighbours contribute **all at once**, weighted, and the result is their **weighted mean** (own weight =
    what the neighbours have not claimed; denominator `max(1, Σw)`, continuous) — the water depth field's
    discipline, so a hex meeting two different reliefs cannot seam along the bisector. Elevation is averaged
    with the same weights, so **prominence follows the art actually showing** (a tall neighbour's spires
    overhang at THEIR prominence, not faded down to ours). No new config levers: the reach and feather reuse
    `peaks.overhang_width` / `softness_width`.
  * The mean is taken in **PREMULTIPLIED alpha** (`premultiplied`/`unpremultiplied` helpers). Relief art is
    RGBA with large transparent regions, and a straight-alpha mean lets a transparent texel's keyed-out RGB
    pollute the colour wherever the other layer is opaque — it drew bright dotted fringes **along** the seam.
  * **Every `peak_tex` fetch uses `textureGrad`** with gradients taken **before any branch** (`puv_dx`/`puv_dy`,
    hoisted above `if (!in_map)`). The peak pass's fetches all sit in divergent control flow, where implicit-LOD
    `texture()` has **UNDEFINED derivatives**: on a 2×2 quad straddling a relief↔relief seam the lanes take
    different branches, the driver picks a garbage mip, and the fetch returns the wrong resolution — which drew
    a **1-pixel dark column exactly along the hex edge**, i.e. a razor line hiding inside an otherwise correct
    cross-fade. This was invisible before only because the seam it hid in was already hard.
  * A snapshot with **no elevation raster** (preview/rehydrated frames) writes `PEAK_ELEV_FALLBACK` for every
    hex, so Δelev = 0 everywhere and every relief↔relief seam is the symmetric cross-fade.
  * **Still a nearest-edge pick:** a **ground** hex touching two DIFFERENT reliefs picks the *nearest* one's
    layer for the overhang/shadow (`nb_peak_code`). Same 1-bit bug class, not yet hit in a frame; the
    accumulator above is the shape of the fix if it ever shows.
- **THE CAST SHADOW MUST DIE OFF WITH DISTANCE FROM THE RELIEF, NOT WITH THE HEX GRID** (the fix for the
  "dark hexagons in the rocky field next to the hills" report). `peak_code > 0` is true for any hex merely
  **ADJACENT** to relief, and the peak art is near-opaque wherever the occlusion taps sample it — so the
  raw occlusion term is roughly **CONSTANT across the whole neighbour hex** and then terminates on **that
  hex's own boundary**: a flat, hex-shaped dark patch painted into the neighbouring biome, on all six sides
  at once (not even directional). Fix: the occlusion is multiplied by a **`shadow_env` envelope** built from
  the very signed distance to the peak↔non-peak boundary the overhang already computes —
  `env = 1 − smoothstep(0, reach, out_dist)`, where `out_dist` is the distance **beyond the (noise-wobbled)
  footline**, so the envelope is FULL at the footline and 0 within `reach`. `reach` is
  `peak_shadow_len` × an **elevation** factor (`PEAK_SHADOW_ELEV_FLOOR`… 1 — a high massif throws a longer
  shadow) × a **DIRECTIONAL** factor: full length where the relief lies TOWARD the light (we are down-light
  of it → in its cast shadow), shrinking to `PEAK_SHADOW_UPLIGHT_REACH` of it on the LIT side. It stays a
  *directional cast shadow*, **not a symmetric halo** — but the lit side keeps a short **contact skirt**
  rather than a hard angular cutoff, because a hard `dot(light, normal) > 0` gate would step to zero right
  at the footline, where the art is only ~half opaque and the shadowed ground shows through: that trades the
  hexagon for a dark crescent.
  **Continuity, the same discipline as the shoreline's signed coast coordinate `u`:** the envelope is
  evaluated per boundary edge from quantities that read **identically on both sides of a shared edge**
  (the signed distance is 0 there from both hexes, and the relief-normal is the same vector), so nothing
  pops at the hex line. It is a **MAX over the qualifying edges, never a sum** — a hex touching relief on two
  sides takes the deeper of the two and cannot **double-darken into a seam**. (Enveloping by the *single
  nearest* edge only — the discipline `peak_code`/prominence still follow — would have been **discontinuous
  along the bisector** where the nearest edge switches, since the two edges' light alignments differ; a max
  of continuous functions is continuous everywhere.) Verify on **`blend_probe` state S**, and judge it on
  **`S_shadow_footprint*.png`** — the amplified diff against a `shadow_strength = 0` render, i.e. the cast
  shadow **in isolation**. That frame is necessary because the relief art overhangs the footline and is
  semi-transparent out there, so neither the eye nor a pixel sample can separate "shadow" from "dark mound
  fringe" in the composited frame.
- **Peak LOD is DECOUPLED from the blend LOD** (own `peaks_lod_enabled`, `radius ≥ peak_min_radius`,
  default 3.0 ≪ `EDGE_BLEND_MIN_RADIUS`), so the mountain mass persists at far zoom; trilinear-mipmapped
  peak array keeps it smooth (no shimmer).
- **Config levers** (`terrain_config.json` → `peaks` block): `overhang_width` / `softness_width`
  (→ `peak_overhang` / `peak_softness` px, like canopy), `texture_scale` (→ `peak_scale`),
  `peak_min_radius` (LOD floor px), `shadow_length` (→ `peak_shadow_len` px) / `shadow_strength`,
  `min_prominence`, and `light_dir_x` / `light_dir_y` (normalized → `peak_light_dir`). Fallbacks are the
  `PEAK_DEFAULT_*` consts in `MapView.gd`. Peaks are shader-only (same caveat as canopy).
- Verify via `tools/map_preview.gd` **State swatch** with `SWATCH_BIOME_ID = 26` (alpine) →
  `map_swatch.png` (+ `map_swatch_farzoom.png`): faceted peaks composite with light-left/dark-right
  self-shading, overhang the alpine↔prairie seam + cast a darkening shadow onto the prairie, and the
  far-zoom alpine band reads as a raised mountain mass. Restore `SWATCH_BIOME_ID = 2` after.

**Rivers — Minor/Major on hex EDGES, Navigable as a water TERRAIN:** rivers are two different kinds of
thing, and the split is the whole design (see `docs/plan_rivers.md`). A **Minor/Major** river lives on a
hex **edge** — that is where a future crossing cost can live ("the side the river is on is the side that
costs") — and is drawn by a **river pass in `terrain_blend.gdshader`** so the water is painted exactly on
the edge the penalty will apply to. A **Navigable** river is a body of water you are *in*, so **in the sim**
it stays an ordinary water terrain (`TerrainType::NavigableRiver`, **id 37** — blocking + boats fall out of
the existing water rules). **Its RENDER, though, is not a water hex** — see the navigable-channel pass
below: a water hex ran through the land↔water shore pass and came out a hex-shaped puddle with a sandy
beach and surf, i.e. **visually identical to an InlandSea lake** and nothing like a river. It is now drawn
as a silty **BANK with a wide channel through it**. The old `HydrologyOverlay` polyline (and
`MapView._draw_hydrology`) is **deleted** — the tiles now fully determine the render.
- **The wire primitive:** `TileState.riverEdges` (`ushort`), decoded in `native/src/lib.rs tile_to_dict`
  as `river_edges` (both the snapshot and delta tile paths share that one function). A **12-bit mask, 2
  bits per odd-r direction** — `class = (river_edges >> (2*dir)) & 0b11`, `0 = none / 1 = Minor / 2 =
  Major` (3 reserved). **Both hexes flanking an edge carry it** (hex `H` dir `d`; the neighbour dir
  `(d+3)%6`), so a hex answers "is there a river on my side `d`?" locally, with no cross-hex sampling.
  Ingested by `MapView.display_snapshot` into `tile_river_edges` (`Vector2i → int`, like
  `tile_habitability`).
- **The SECOND wire primitive — `TileState.riverInflow`** (`ushort`, decoded as `river_inflow` by the same
  `tile_to_dict`, ingested into `tile_river_inflow`): the same 12-bit / 2-bits-per-slot packing, but keyed
  by hex **CORNER** — `class = (river_inflow >> (2*corner)) & 0b11`. **Why it must exist:** an edge river
  runs *along* a side, so it does not end mid-edge, **it ends at a VERTEX** — and a trunk hex can flank two
  or three river edges (the tributary ran along several of its sides on the way in), which `river_edges`
  alone cannot disambiguate. So the sim names the hand-over vertex. It means **"a tributary hands over to the
  channel at this vertex"** — true of **ANY** navigable hex, **not** just a chain head (a real drainage network
  joins tributaries to trunks MID-CHAIN; the semantics widened with `docs/plan_rivers_drainage_network.md` §A —
  same field, same bits, same corner convention). A navigable hex with no tributary reports 0; more than one
  corner may be set (two tributaries can terminate on the same hex), so **loop all 6**. **Never read it as
  "this hex is a chain HEAD"** — that is what `river_channel`'s exit count says (below), and keying the head
  taper off inflow is exactly the HOURGLASS bug. Corner
  `i` is the vertex at angle `60*i + 30`, +y down — **exactly `MapView._hex_points` order** (0 lower-right,
  1 bottom, 2 lower-left, 3 upper-left, 4 top, 5 upper-right), so the shader derives it from the hex centre
  and radius with no table; side `dir` spans corners `{dir-1, dir}`. **Deliberately NOT surfaced in the
  Tile card / tooltip** — it is a rendering detail, not player-facing geography (`RiverEdges.gd` still
  reports the SIDES, which is what a crossing cost will key on).
- **The THIRD wire primitive — `TileState.riverChannel`** (`ubyte`, decoded as `river_channel` by the same
  `tile_to_dict`, ingested into `tile_river_channel`): **1 bit per odd-r direction** —
  `exits(dir) = (river_channel >> dir) & 1` — naming the sides a **navigable** hex's channel actually flows
  out through: its upstream and downstream neighbours in its own chain, plus (on the chain's LAST hex only)
  its exit into the sea / inland sea / `RiverDelta` mouth. **Why it must exist:** the trunk's connectivity
  is a **path**, and terrain cannot say which two of a hex's neighbours are on it. The renderer used to
  infer an arm for every navigable/water/`RiverDelta` neighbour, and wherever navigable hexes sat adjacent
  — parallel reaches, a chain bending back on itself, the blob a buggy worldgen once emitted — that rule
  **cross-linked them into a spider WEB with triangular holes**. Only the sim's tracer knows the path, so
  the sim states it and the shader arms **only the set bits**. Symmetric across a shared side **except at
  the mouth** (open water carries no channel, so that bit is not mirrored back) — so read the OWN hex's
  bits and never assume the neighbour agrees. It does **not** double-encode the head: the sim sets no exit
  toward the tributary, because the inflow SPUR (above) draws that. Do not "simplify" this back to a
  terrain test — `map_rivers_web.png` is the regression guard, and a web there is that bug returning.
- **The shader's `neighbor_offset` table IS a wire contract now.** It was reordered to the SIM's odd-r
  direction order (`core_sim` `grid_utils::HEX_NEIGHBOR_OFFSETS`, clockwise from E: 0=E, 1=SE, 2=SW, 3=W,
  4=NW, 5=NE) because the river pass indexes the mask **by direction**. The blend/shore/canopy/peak passes
  only ever loop over all 6 and are order-agnostic, so the reorder was free — but **do not reorder it
  again**.
- **RGBA8 river-map splatmap** (`_rebuild_terrain_shader_maps`): all four id-map channels are already
  taken (id / blend_class / canopy / peak), so the river masks get their **own** texture — and BOTH ride
  it: `R/G = river_edges` (low 8 / high 4), `B/A = river_inflow` (low 8 / high 4). Two 12-bit masks are 24
  bits, so they do not fit one RG8 texel; one RGBA8 texture is cheaper than a second sampler. NEAREST,
  rebuilt each snapshot — **after** the tile loop in `display_snapshot` (it reads `tile_river_edges` /
  `tile_river_inflow`, which the tiles populate). All 32 of ITS bits are now spoken for too, so
  `river_channel` (6 bits) rides a **second, R8 `river_channel_map`** built in the same pass, also NEAREST.
- **River pass (shader), after the shore pass, before canopy/peaks:** trees overhang a river and mountains
  sit above it; sitting before the FoW tint, a river in a Discovered tile **dims with the mist rather than
  disappearing**. Per fragment, for each of the own hex's carrying edges: distance to the **shared edge
  SEGMENT** — `mid ± perp * (hex_radius * 0.5)` (a regular hexagon's side == its circumradius), clamped to
  the segment, **not** the infinite bisector, which would smear the band across the whole hex — then keep
  the edge with the **max coverage** (`half_width - distance`). That min-distance-over-edges pick is what
  **rounds the corner joins for free**: a 120° turn softens with no spline math. The water samples in
  continuous map space (`v_map`, like the canopy) plus a **`TIME` scroll along the winning edge's tangent**
  so it flows.
- **THE HONEYCOMB, and what actually fixes it — read this before touching the river look.** An edge river
  drawn as a wide, constant-width, hard-edged stroke reads as *the hex borders, inked blue*. The instinct is
  to meander harder. **That is a dead end, and not because the meander is under-tuned:**
  - the amplitude ceiling is real — past ~`0.24` of the warp cell the warp's gradient exceeds the band
    half-width and the river **tears into disconnected pools**; and
  - more fundamentally the river is **edge-LOCKED by design**. The water must be painted on the edge the
    future crossing cost applies to ("the side the river is on is the side that costs"), so a warp can only
    displace the band about a band-width before it **detaches from its own edge and starts lying about the
    geometry**. Pushing meander trades a honeycomb for a lie.
  What actually kills the honeycomb, in order of impact: **(1) THINNESS** — halved to `minor_width 0.05` /
  `major_width 0.09`; a thin stroke reads as a river, a wide one as an outline. **(2) WIDTH VARIATION ALONG
  the river** (`width_variation`, low-frequency world noise on a `RIVER_WIDTH_NOISE_CELL = 2.6` hex-radii
  cell — deliberately several radii, so a swell is a property of the *reach*, not of the hex; a cell near 1
  would re-key the variation to the lattice and *reinforce* the honeycomb). **(3) RAGGED BANKS** — a
  higher-frequency wobble of the half-width (`bank_noise_width`, `RIVER_BANK_NOISE_CELL = 0.35`), the same
  idiom as the shore pass's noisy `reach`, plus a wider `softness_width`. Both noises are sampled in
  **world space** (`v_map`), so the two hexes flanking an edge get identical values at the shared boundary —
  the symmetric **no-seam** meeting of the two half-bands survives. A `RIVER_MIN_HALF_WIDTH` px floor keeps
  the noise from severing the band (and keeps it a legible hairline at far zoom).
- **MEANDER — a domain warp, not a distance bias.** Kept (it still bends the centerline rather than
  bulging/pinching a straight one) but **capped**, per the above: `RIVER_MEANDER_CELL = 0.9` hex radii,
  `meander_width = 0.22`. The warp cell is keyed to `hex_radius`, **not** the shared px-sized `noise_cell`
  (which would make the wander's character change with zoom and only fuzz the bank). It is warped ONCE per
  fragment in world space, so both flanking hexes warp the same point → no seam.
- **ONE river growing, not two spliced.** The two class textures are deliberately different art (`00_minor`
  light/shallow-over-gravel, `01_major` dark/deep), and untreated they meet as turquoise-next-to-near-black:
  a class change read as *two waterways joining*. Two shader fixes, no art edits: (a) the class **crossfades**
  — the pass tracks the best coverage per class and mixes the two layers by
  `smoothstep(-river_class_blend, river_class_blend, cov_major - cov_minor)`, so a hex carrying both classes
  dissolves one into the other over `class_blend_width` (a pure-class hex is unaffected: the loser stays at
  `-1e9`); and (b) `river_harmonize()` pulls both layers' luma toward `RIVER_DEPTH_PIVOT`
  (`depth_compress`) and their chroma toward `RIVER_SHARED_HUE` (`tint_strength`), preserving the luma
  ORDER — Minor stays lighter, Major deeper — which is the thing that should say *bigger*.
- **NAVIGABLE-CHANNEL pass (shader), right AFTER the Minor/Major pass** (so a Major feeding a navigable
  trunk composites into it), before canopy/peaks. **This is a RENDER-ONLY change — the sim is untouched.**
  Three parts:
  - **`blend_class` is `"flat"`, not `"water"`** (a *render* eligibility class with no sim meaning — the
    sim's `WATER | FRESHWATER` tags and water movement profile are unchanged). Treating it as land is
    correct — it takes the hex **out of the shore pass** (no beach, no foam) and lets it **blend softly
    into neighbouring flat land**, merging the corridor into the landscape.
  - **A navigable hex is a VALLEY with a river in it — its base renders the UNDERLYING biome, not a
    whole-hex bank** (rivers slice #3, `docs/plan_rivers.md` → "A navigable hex is a valley with a river
    in it"). The old whole-hex silty-bank base (`biome_array` layer 37) hid the land; now the hex body
    renders the **valley the river cut**, with only a **slim silty-bank skirt hugging the channel**. Two
    wire/shader pieces:
    - **The valley biome rides its OWN wire field + map.** `TileState.underlyingTerrain` (== the tile's own
      `terrain` on ordinary tiles, the preserved valley biome on a navigable hex) is decoded in
      `native/src/lib.rs` as `underlying_terrain`, ingested into `MapView.tile_underlying_terrain`, and
      packed into a NEW R8 `navigable_underlying_map` (built in `_rebuild_terrain_shader_maps` beside the
      river-channel map). The shader swaps the base sample from layer 37 to `navigable_underlying_map`'s id
      **only on a navigable hex** (`own_navigable`); everywhere else `base_layer == own_layer`, a no-op.
      **The `id_map` R channel STAYS terrain id 37** — that is the navigability signal the shader keys
      `own_navigable`/the channel pass on; only the *base texture* is swapped, never the id.
    - **The bank is a thin annulus riding the channel's distance field.** In the navigable channel pass, the
      silty bank (`biome_array` layer for id 37 — resolved via `river_navigable_terrain_id`, never hard-coded)
      is composited OVER the underlying base across an annulus just outside the water, out to
      `river_navigable_bank_half_width` beyond the channel edge (`bank_cov = best_cov +
      river_navigable_bank_half_width`, so it follows every arm/spur/taper/turn/mouth for free); the water
      channel then paints OVER the bank as before. Read across the hex: water (dist < navigable half-width) →
      thin bank gravel (out to + bank half-width) → underlying terrain. Config lever
      `rivers.navigable_bank_width` (**0.10**, hex-radius fraction → the `river_navigable_bank_half_width`
      uniform via `RIVER_DEFAULT_NAVIGABLE_BANK_WIDTH`).
    - The bank's base texture (`textures/base/37_navigable_river.png`) is still the **BANK ground**
      (placeholder: a copy of `09_floodplain`; real silty-bank art lands later) and its config `color` (the
      fallback solid + minimap pixel) is a bank tone. **The id-37 layer ALSO carries a per-terrain
      `blend_profile`** (`2.6 / 2.2 / 2.6` — see Edge Blending), retained for the bank's flat↔flat seams;
      judge the bank contrast on `blend_probe` state **17 (BANK)**. **The `blend_class` G-channel code stays
      "flat" (from terrain 37)** — since both the valley base and its flat neighbours are flat class, the
      flat↔flat blend fires and the navigable hex body merges seamlessly into the surrounding land with no
      hard hex seam (verified on `map_rivers_navigable.png`/`map_rivers_web.png`). Writing the underlying
      terrain's blend_class into the id-map for navigable hexes was NOT needed; a possible follow-up only if
      a valley biome of a *different* class (rugged) ever seams.
  - The shore pass additionally **skips a TRUE MOUTH edge — the one navigable edge whose `river_channel`
    exits through it INTO the water**: `blend_class` alone is not enough at the MOUTH, where the (now-land)
    bank would take a beach and the sea across from it would draw a **surf line across the river's mouth** —
    the river visibly walled off from the sea it drains into. A river meeting the sea is not a coast.
    **But the test must be per-EDGE, not "any navigable hex on either side"** — that over-broad exclusion
    (the original) also fired where a navigable river merely runs **ALONGSIDE** a lake without draining into
    it (a real @21,61 case: a one-hex `InlandSea` ringed by 3 navigable hexes, **none** of whose channels
    exit toward it), eating the lake's own shore ring on those edges and leaving a hard seam (glaring now
    that the bank renders the valley terrain, not neutral gravel). So the pass reads the sim-authored R8
    `river_channel_map` (the same mask the channel pass arms from; the shore loop's `dir` is already sim
    odd-r order, matching the channel bit index) and skips ONLY a true mouth — by the time the check runs
    exactly one side is navigable (flat/land) and the other genuine water, so it reads the channel from
    whichever side is navigable, toward the water: own navigable → its exit bit for `dir`; neighbour
    navigable → its exit bit toward us, `(dir+3)%6`. Everywhere else (alongside, no exit here) falls through
    to the normal coast, so the lake keeps its full ring and the valley/bank gets its beach. **This stays an
    EDGE-LEVEL exclusion, not a `shore_profile` entry** (see Shoreline → per-water-terrain shore profile):
    the profile is keyed on the **water** side — only a `CLASS_WATER` hex contributes one — and a navigable
    hex is land-class, so it can never supply one; the profile that would apply at the mouth is the
    **sea's/lake's**, which must keep its coast everywhere else. Dropping a mouth edge removes the whole
    chain at once (profile, waterline cross-fade, sand, surf, wisp all live under the pass's `best_d` guard)
    and does so symmetrically from **both** hexes' frames, so no half-drawn coast survives on one side of it.
    Judged on `map_rivers_lake_alongside.png` (the alongside lake keeps its ring) vs `map_rivers_mouth.png`
    (the true mouth stays open).
  - The **channel** (`river_tex` **layer 2**, `textures/rivers/02_navigable.png` — the deep teal water that
    used to be the terrain's base) is TWO kinds of stroke, unioned by the **max-coverage (min-distance)**
    pick — the same trick that rounds the Minor/Major corner joins, here fusing them into one connected
    body with rounded junctions for free:
    - **TRUNK ARMS**, at the channel's own (navigable) width: hex **CENTRE → the MIDPOINT** of each side
      **`river_channel` says the river flows out through** (`(mask >> dir) & 1`). **The connectivity is
      SIM-AUTHORED, not inferred from the neighbouring terrain** — see the third wire primitive above. The
      old rule (arm every navigable / water / `RiverDelta` neighbour) is exactly what drew the **WEB**:
      adjacent navigable hexes that are not consecutive on the chain got cross-linked, and the corridor
      filled with triangles. The mask also carries the mouth (the last hex's unmirrored exit into the sea /
      delta), so the river still does not dead-end a hex short of the sea. The arm needs **no neighbour
      fetch** — only the neighbour's CENTRE, which is pure math — so it also draws correctly at the map
      border and across the wrap seam.
    - **INFLOW SPURS**, at the arriving tributary's **own Minor/Major width**: hex **CENTRE → the CORNER**
      named by `river_inflow` (all 6 checked; a mask bit needs no neighbour fetch, so it spurs even at the
      map border / across the wrap seam). The spur wears the tributary's class art and **crossfades** into
      the channel over `class_blend_width` — the edge pass's Minor→Major crossfade, for the same reason:
      one river growing, not two waterways spliced. **This centre-hub form is used for a MID-CHAIN junction
      (`>= 2` exits with an inflow) — a hex the trunk passes THROUGH, whose centre is genuinely on the flow.**
    - **A CHAIN HEAD FED BY A TRIBUTARY routes STRAIGHT from the inflow corner to its single exit, NOT via
      the centre** (the notch fix). On a head (`exits == 1`) with an inflow, the centre-hub form draws the
      inflow as a centre→corner spur and the exit as a centre→edge-midpoint arm; when the inflow corner and
      the exit side flank the **same** vertex, that union is `inflow_corner → centre → exit_mid`, which
      **DOUBLES BACK into a NOTCH / inverted-V at the corner** (reads as "the tributary hooks into the wrong
      corner"). So a head-with-inflow instead draws ONE tapered segment per inflow corner — `inflow_corner →
      exit-midpoint` — narrow (the tributary's own width) at the corner, swelling to the full navigable width
      at the exit edge (the head taper, now laid along the true flow line), with the tributary art
      crossfading to the channel art along it (`head_class_mix`). `t_head` is the UNWARPED projection, same as
      the arm loop, so the exit edge still lands on exactly `navigable_half_width` and the downstream hex
      meets it with no step. It **rides the same `best_cov`** the bank annulus reads, so the slim bank follows
      the new flow line for free. Multiple inflow corners on one head (a Major+Minor confluence, the join
      frame) draw one segment each, unioned into a Y at the exit. Judged on `map_rivers_notch.png` (inflow at
      the bottom vertex, single exit on the adjacent SW side — the exact geometry that notched).
    - **HEAD TAPER — a trunk does not spring to full width at a hex centre.** On the **first hex of a
      chain** — **gated on the `river_channel` EXIT COUNT (`<= RIVER_CHANNEL_HEAD_MAX_EXITS`, i.e. 1), NOT on
      `river_inflow != 0`**: a head has only its downstream link; a mid-chain hex has its upstream one too (2),
      a confluence 3. Since the drainage network a tributary hands over at ANY navigable hex's vertex, so an
      inflow-gated taper would **pinch the full-width trunk to the tributary's width at a mid-chain junction's
      centre and swell it back out on both sides — a visible HOURGLASS in mid-channel.** The **SPUR stays
      unconditional**: it carries the tributary from the hex centre out to its vertex, and a mid-chain junction
      needs it MORE (without it the tributary dead-ends at the vertex, short of the arms, which only reach the
      edge midpoints). Judged on `map_rivers_midchain.png`. On a head, the arms **start at the half-width of the
      WIDEST class feeding in** (max over the 6 inflow corners — Major wins if any Major lands, and the
      sim already stores the widest class per corner) and **swell to the full navigable width by the hex
      EDGE**: `half_w = mix(inflow_half_width, navigable_half_width, pow(smoothstep(0,1,t), head_taper_curve))`,
      `t` = the arm's own centre→edge-midpoint projection. Without it a hairline Minor arrived at a vertex
      and was a great river a few px later — a jump-cut, not a river. Any hex that is **not** a chain head (or
      is a head with no tributary) is **unchanged**: `inflow_half_width` stays the navigable width and the mix
      is a no-op — no extra per-hex branching.
      **`t` is taken from the UNWARPED point** (unlike the distance-to-centerline `t`, which must use the
      meander-warped one), and that is load-bearing: every fragment on the shared edge projects to
      **exactly `1.0`** on the arm axis (the edge line's projection onto the arm direction is the apothem,
      whatever the lateral offset), so the taper lands on **exactly** `navigable_half_width` where the
      next, constant-width navigable hex takes over — no step, no notch at the head's downstream edge. The
      warped point's projection would wander by the meander amplitude and leave one. A hex with **>= 2 channel
      exits** is mid-chain and keeps the CONSTANT full navigable width, whatever its inflow. Width is a scalar
      field of world position here, the same as `river_width_mod` / `river_bank_wobble` (both also sampled
      unwarped), and the organic machinery rides **on top of** the tapered base width, so the continuity
      guarantees survive. The taper also makes the **spur→trunk join seamless**: the trunk now leaves the
      centre at the same width the spur arrives there with.
    - **An arm is NOT keyed off `river_edges`** — that was the fat-teal-blob bug. An edge river runs ALONG
      a side; it does not flow through the side's MIDPOINT, and a trunk head can flank two or three river
      edges, so the mask-armed rule drew three fat centre→midpoint arms **at the trunk's width** and the
      hex filled with water. Water enters a trunk hex at a **vertex**, which is what `river_inflow` names.
    A navigable hex with **zero arms** (the sim should never emit one; an inflow spur is not an arm) draws
    a centre **blob** rather than a hex of bare bank, and `MapView._warn_orphan_navigable_rivers`
    `push_warning`s it — now a pure MASK test (no `river_channel` exit **and** no `river_inflow` = water
    neither enters nor leaves), mirroring the shader's arm rule; keep the two in step.
  - It reuses the **same organic machinery** as the edge pass — the `river_meander_warp` domain warp, the
    low-frequency `river_width_mod` swell, the `river_bank_wobble` ragged bank (all three factored into
    shared shader functions rather than copied) — and `river_harmonize`, so the trunk reads as the same
    river grown bigger. All noise is sampled in **WORLD space**, which is exactly what makes the channel
    **continuous across adjacent navigable hexes**: both hexes warp the same point and read the same width
    at their shared boundary, so the half-channels line up with no seam, pinch or gap. The **spurs ride the
    same three**, which is why a tributary's band arrives at the vertex already warped exactly as the edge
    pass warped it on the far side — the two meet without a notch.
- **Config levers** (`terrain_config.json` → `rivers` block): `minor_width` / `major_width` /
  **`navigable_width`** (the channel HALF-width as a fraction of the hex radius — `0.14`: clearly the
  biggest water on the map, but **only somewhat** wider than Major's `0.09`. It shipped at `0.24` and read
  as a flood filling the hex, which is the puddle read this whole pass exists to kill; softness / meander / width-variation /
  bank-noise / flow-speed are **shared with the edge classes**, not duplicated per class) /
  `softness_width` / `meander_width` / `bank_noise_width` / `class_blend_width` (fractions of the hex radius
  → px uniforms, computed in `_update_terrain_shader_quad` exactly like `blend_width` / `canopy_overhang`),
  the unitless `width_variation` / `tint_strength` / `depth_compress` / **`head_taper_curve`** (the
  exponent on the head taper's smoothstep — `0.8` ships, i.e. swell slightly EARLY; `1.0` = plain
  smoothstep, `> 1` holds the tributary's width longer then flares. An exponent, never a width, so it
  cannot disturb the exact navigable-width match at the hex edge), plus `texture_scale`,
  `river_min_radius` (the LOD floor), and `flow_speed`. Fallbacks are the `RIVER_DEFAULT_*` consts in
  `MapView.gd`.
- **River LOD is DECOUPLED from the blend LOD** (own `rivers_lod_enabled`, `radius ≥ river_min_radius`,
  default 3.0 ≪ `EDGE_BLEND_MIN_RADIUS`) — a river is a landmark you navigate *by*, so it must survive
  zooming out; the mipmapped/trilinear river array keeps the thin band stable (no shimmer).
- **`set_highlight_rivers`** (the Map tab toggle) survives, repointed from the deleted polyline draw to the
  shader's `river_highlight` uniform.
- **TEXT surfacing — `ui/RiverEdges.gd`, ONE formatter, two surfaces.** Seeing the water isn't knowing
  which SIDES carry it — which is exactly what a crossing penalty will key on. `MapView._tile_info_at`
  copies the mask onto the tile dict as `river_edges` (from `tile_river_edges`; **deliberately NOT in
  `FOW_DISCOVERED_HIDDEN_KEYS`** — a river is permanent geography like the terrain label or a discovered
  Wondrous Site, so a remembered tile still reports it; never-seen tiles are already covered by the
  `unexplored` redaction), and both the **Tile card** (`Hud._tile_terrain_lines`, with the other
  terrain-intrinsic rows, before the FoW discovered early-return) and the **map hover tooltip**
  (`Hud.show_tooltip`, after `Terrain:`) render it from the same `RiverEdges.summary_lines(mask)` call.
  `RiverEdges` owns the vocabulary (classes + direction names + bit widths as named constants) and emits
  **one line PER CLASS, Major first** — `Major River: NE, NW` / `Minor River: SW` — plain `Key: Value`
  rows needing no `_format_detail_bbcode` tint case, and an **empty array on a riverless tile** so no
  empty label renders. It keeps **two direction orders**: the sim's `HEX_NEIGHBOR_OFFSETS` order
  (clockwise from E — the wire contract) DECODES the mask, and a **compass display order** (clockwise
  from NE) lists the directions within a line, because a compass reading is what a player parses.
  ui_preview: `river_tile_both` (two-class) / `river_tile_minor` (single-class) / `river_tile_none` (no row).
- **Caveat — rivers are shader-only** (same as canopy/peaks): the blend-OFF **per-hex CPU path** renders no
  rivers. That is the reference/fallback path only; the live client runs blend-on.
- Verify via `tools/map_preview.gd` State **rivers** → `map_rivers.png` (a Minor→Major edge river wandering
  west→east with corner turns, joining a NavigableRiver chain that turns corners of its own and drains to
  the eastern sea — **with a real InlandSea lake in the same frame as the control**: the lake keeps its
  beach + surf, the navigable hexes have neither, and the two must read as obviously different things) +
  `map_rivers_seam.png` (edge/corner close-up framing the class change: the band hugs the EDGE, joins are
  rounded, the two half-bands meet with no seam down the middle, Minor grows into Major) +
  `map_rivers_navigable.png` (the trunk: the Major edge river flowing INTO it, the corner turns, and the
  channel CONTINUOUS across adjacent navigable hexes) + `map_rivers_mouth.png` (the channel reaching open
  sea + its delta lobe — no dead-end, and no surf line across the mouth) +
  `map_rivers_head_minor.png` (the HEAD TAPER's own frame: a second, one-hex navigable branch fed by a
  **Minor tributary only** — its arm must start hairline at the centre and swell to the full channel width
  by the shared edge with the trunk, with **no step** there; the Major+Minor head in `map_rivers_join.png`
  is the other half of the test, starting at the **wider** — Major — width) +
  `map_rivers_farzoom.png` (decoupled LOD). The fixture generates the edge chain as the **boundary of a
  region** (hexes north of a bank row `f(x)`), which is contiguous by construction — no gaps — and turns a
  corner at every step; the navigable chain then WALKS `RIVER_NAV_STEPS` (E/SE/E/NE/E) out to the sea, so the
  trunk's arm/junction geometry is actually exercised. The river is kept in the map's **upper rows**
  deliberately: the map is cover-fit and that fit is the zoom FLOOR, so on a window wider than the grid's
  aspect the lower rows cannot be scrolled into view at all. **`RIVER_PATTERN` must stay a mostly-MONOTONE drift**: an up-down-up staircase makes
  the boundary wrap 4+ sides of the same hexagon, manufacturing a honeycomb that real hydrology (a downhill
  walk on the corner lattice) never produces — the original fixture did exactly that and made the render
  look far worse than it is.

**Texture readback fix (kept from A):** `TerrainTextureManager` retains the CPU-side layer Images
(`_layer_images`) captured once at build time; `get_terrain_image` serves duplicates from it and
**never** calls `Texture2DArray.get_layer_data()` again (a second readback returned a blank image on
some drivers, whitening the base). The `sampler2DArray` uniform is the same `terrain_textures`.

Verify via `tools/map_preview.gd` State Q → `ui_preview_out/map_biome_hard.png` (blend off, the
reference) vs `map_biome_blend.png` (Approach B on), plus `map_biome_blend_seam.png` (desert↔prairie
close-up): the flat pair blends symmetrically, prairie↔forest / forest↔ocean stay crisp, and terrain
stays aligned with the grid. **State S** (`map_repetition_after.png` + `..._zoom.png`) renders a large
detailed-rugged field (alpine id 26) beside a flat prairie band: the continuous world-space base
sampling means NO per-hex identical-repeat grid on the alpine (each hex shows a different region of the
texture, features flow across boundaries), while the prairie↔alpine seam stays a hard edge.

**Fallback considered:** a MultiMesh (one instance per hex) was the fallback if whole-map inverse-hex
alignment couldn't be matched; the splatmap alignment held, so the single-quad path was chosen (fewer
moving parts, no per-frame instance transforms). **Future:** blue-noise sample instead of hash value
noise. A **per-hex UV rotation+offset for rugged biomes** (hard-edged, so cross-edge rotation
discontinuities hide) was speced to break the texture's *own* tiling-period repeat, but the continuous
world-space base sampling alone removed the objectionable per-hex grid (verified on alpine id 26 at
`base_scale = 0.25`), so it was NOT needed. Do NOT rotate flat biomes — it would break their cross-edge
blend continuity.

## HUD Panel Framework (Docked PanelCards)

The HUD (`HudLayer.tscn`) owns the screen regions with one layout authority — a
`RootColumn` VBox split into `TopBar` / `ContentRow(LeftDock · center · RightDock)`
/ `BottomBar`. No panel positions itself with absolute offsets into a region;
everything is container-sized so regions never collide.

### Reserved-edge docking (4-edge, multi-reserver registry)
A docked panel does not overlap or rearrange gameplay panels — it *reserves* a
strip of one screen edge, shrinking the game area to fit beside it, as if the
window were that much smaller. The mechanism is a **reservation registry** keyed
by reserver id, so multiple panels can reserve (possibly different) edges at once:

- **`MapView.set_reserved_inset(id: StringName, edge: int, size: float)`** and
  **`Hud.set_reserved_inset(id, edge, size)`** — `edge` is a Godot `Side` const
  (`SIDE_LEFT/SIDE_TOP/SIDE_RIGHT/SIDE_BOTTOM`); `size <= 0` releases the reserver.
  Each stores `{edge, size}` under `id` and recomputes four per-edge totals
  (`left/right/top/bottom` = Σ of sizes whose edge matches).
- **`Main._apply_reservation(id, edge, size)`** fans a reserver's contribution out
  to both surfaces. Two reservers today: the **Inspector** (`&"inspector"`,
  `SIDE_LEFT` — `reserved_width()` / `reserved_width_changed` on show/hide + live
  drag-resize) and the **Band/City panel** (`&"band_panel"`, its currently-docked
  edge — see below).
- **`MapView`** applies the totals via three coordinated pieces:
  1. `_get_adjusted_viewport_size()` subtracts `left+right` on x and `top+bottom`
     on y, so fit, pan-clamp, draw extents, hit-testing and the minimap indicator
     all treat the remaining rect as the whole viewport.
  2. The node is translated by the **leading** insets only (`position =
     Vector2(left, top)`; trailing right/bottom just shrink the viewport), so the
     reduced coordinate space renders beside the panel(s). Because
     `get_local_mouse_position()` accounts for the node transform, clicks stay
     correct without touching any screen↔hex math.
  3. `_apply_view_clip()` (in `_draw`, via `RenderingServer.canvas_item_set_clip`)
     clips every draw command to the usable rect whenever **any** inset > 0. The
     map is **cover-fit**, so its content is larger than the reduced viewport and
     would otherwise overflow into a reserved strip; clipping confines it.
  - `_is_local_point_in_view()` bounds hit-testing to the full adjusted-viewport
    rect on **both** axes (`0 ≤ local ≤ adjusted` in x and y), so a click under a
    left/top/right/bottom strip is rejected, not just a left one.
- **`Hud`** applies the four totals to `LayoutRoot` offsets: `offset_left = left`,
  `offset_top = top`, `offset_right = -right`, `offset_bottom = -bottom`, so every
  bar and dock lives in the smaller rect.

Because the HUD, reservers, and map all sit under the same `content_scale`
transform, each reservation is a single canvas-space value that applies to all
surfaces with no per-surface scaling. Panels keep their natural docks.

### PanelCard (`ui/PanelCard.gd`)
The single building block for every dock panel. It is a `PanelContainer` (never a
bare `Panel`) that owns the chrome — styled background + title header — and hosts
caller content in a plain `VBoxContainer`. Because it is container-sized, it
always reports a correct minimum size, so the dock reflows automatically.

- **Content contract:** author one child `VBoxContainer` named `CardContent`. The
  card inserts its title header as that container's first row and **never
  reparents the authored widgets** — reparenting them into a runtime wrapper
  silently clears `unique_name_in_owner`, so `%Name` references from the owner
  script break. Reference inner widgets by unique name (`%Name`).
- **Rule:** no anchor-positioned children inside a card. Anchor layout inside a
  container parent is what made the legacy `Panel`s overlap.
- API: `card_title` / `set_card_title()`, `get_content()`, and `hotkey_hint`
  (renders the toggle key in the header, e.g. `"Terrain Types (L)"`; leave empty
  for panels with no show/hide hotkey).
- Replaces the bespoke `ui/AutoSizingPanel.gd` height math — the dock's own
  `ScrollContainer` owns overflow, so cards only size to content.

### PanelDock (`ui/PanelDock.gd`)
Ordered controller for one dock region's `VBoxContainer`. Panels `add(panel,
priority)` to register; the dock reparents them in priority order. Visibility is
data-driven — `set_relevant(panel, false)` (or `panel.visible = false`) removes a
panel from layout flow and the stack reflows with no gap. Hud builds `left_dock`
and `right_dock` in `_ready()`.

**Scroll behaviour:** on construction the dock disables **horizontal** scrolling
on its enclosing `ScrollContainer` and zeroes the stack's horizontal minimum, so
the stack always fills the dock width and content wraps to fit rather than
spilling under a sideways scrollbar (which reads as unpolished for a game HUD).
**Vertical** scroll mode is *not* set by PanelDock — it is configured per dock in
the scene (`HudLayer.tscn`); both docks use `AUTO`, so a scrollbar appears only
when the stack actually overflows.

**Migration status:** `TilePanel`, `OccupantsPanel` (the split selection cards),
`CommandFeedPanel`, and
`TerrainLegendPanel` are now `PanelCard`s (the last two dropped the bespoke
`AutoSizingPanel` height math and the legend's absolute `PRESET_TOP_RIGHT`
positioning that used to overlap the Victory panel). `StockpilePanel` and
`VictoryPanel` are still plain `PanelContainer`s (correctly container-sized, but
not yet cards). `AutoSizingPanel.gd` remains only for the Inspector.

## Map markers (MapView hex-icon stack UX)

Co-located hex markers no longer overlap at the hex center. Markers split into two
classes by their source array (not a predicate): **PRIMARY** = player bands, drawn by
`MapView._draw_primary_bands` over the `units`/`populations` array; **SECONDARY** = herds /
food sites / wondrous sites, placed by `MapView._compute_secondary_slots`. (Tuning consts
are grouped near the top of `MapView.gd`, after the FoW/height consts.)

- **PRIMARY — player bands** own the **center spotlight** as an offset card-stack
  (`_draw_primary_bands`/`_draw_band_stack`/`_draw_band_token`). Each band's token is its
  **settlement-stage glyph** — the opaque `settlement_stage_icon` string the sim resolves from
  `settlement_stage_config.json` (⛺ nomadic / 🛖 camp / 🏘️ village today) — drawn via the shared
  `_draw_marker_glyph` drop-shadow helper (`BAND_STAGE_GLYPH_SIZE_FACTOR`), **no faction ring or
  disc**. Ownership is carried by a **faction-colored nameplate banner** (`_draw_band_banner`,
  `BAND_BANNER_*` consts) — a short rounded bar under the token filled with the band's faction
  color, drawn for the **active (primary) card only** and LOD-suppressed below
  `ICON_MIN_DETAIL_RADIUS`. The banner is intentionally sized as the substrate for an optional
  faction/band **name label** later (text on the bar). When `settlement_stage_icon` is empty
  (pre-stage / missing snapshot — rare) the token draws a small **neutral non-circular** fallback
  marker (gray square, `BAND_FALLBACK_MARKER_*`) instead of the glyph, never a disc. The stage
  label (`settlement_stage_label`) surfaces as the Occupants roster row's hover tooltip.
  Multiple bands on one hex fan up-right: up to `BAND_STACK_MAX_CARDS` (3) cards,
  back cards **darkened** (glyph multiplied by `BAND_STACK_BEHIND_TINT` so they recede/shadow),
  the **active** band (the one whose `entity == selected_unit_id`, else the first) drawn
  full-brightness on top. The active band reads by brightness alone — there is **no per-token
  selection ring** (the hex selection outline marks the tile); `BAND_STACK_BEHIND_TINT` is the
  single lever for the recede effect (RGB<1 darkens, alpha<1 fades — swap between the two there).
  Beyond 3, a `×N` count pill folded onto the **right end of the banner** (nameplate-with-count).
  Food-days dot + the travel arrow draw on the active card only.
- **SECONDARY — herds / food sites / wondrous sites** ring the hex in **fixed edge slots**
  (`SECONDARY_SLOT_OFFSETS`, near the hex corners), computed once per frame in
  `_compute_secondary_slots` by category priority **wonder → food → herd** (sequential fill,
  so icons never jump frame-to-frame). Cap `SECONDARY_VISIBLE_CAP` (3) visible icons; extras
  collapse into a `+N` overflow chip (`_draw_secondary_overflow`). Glyphs drop the old dark
  backing disc for a 1px drop shadow (`_draw_marker_glyph`). Herd migration arrow is thinner
  and only drawn on the hovered/selected herd tile. The `×N`/`+N` pills share `_draw_count_pill`.
- **Selected + hovered hex outline** (`_draw_tile_selection_highlight`, reusing `_outline_hex`):
  a solid white hex outline on `selected_tile`, a faint one on `_hovered_tile` (skipped when
  hover == selection) — this replaces the old selection-as-marker-ring feel.
- **Select-then-cycle** (`handle_hex_click` + `cycle_index`): re-clicking the current
  `selected_tile` with >1 band advances `cycle_index` (mod band count) so the stack surfaces the
  next band on top; a fresh tile resets to the top band. `select_occupant` (roster click) syncs
  `cycle_index` to the picked band's stack position via `_cycle_index_for_unit`.
- **Zoom LOD**: below `ICON_MIN_DETAIL_RADIUS` (far zoom, tiny hexes) secondary icons + all
  count/overflow chips are suppressed; only primary tokens draw.

Verify visual changes via `tools/map_preview.gd` (`godot --path . res://tools/map_preview.tscn`
→ `ui_preview_out/map_band_stack.png` / `map_mixed_hex.png` / `map_far_zoom.png` /
`map_stage_glyphs.png` (the ⛺→🛖→🏘️ progression + empty-stage neutral non-circular fallback marker) + the existing
labor-highlight states).

## Command Targeting

Labor allocation is source-centric (assign workers to a source/role, see the **Labor
allocation UI** bullet below). The one remaining **targeting mode** is **move-band** —
picking a destination tile — replacing the old easy-to-miss "select a band…" line.

- **Selection split — Tile card + Occupants roster** (`Hud.gd`): the old single
  selection panel is now **two left-dock `PanelCard`s driven by one script**. The
  **Tile card** (`TilePanel`/`%TileDetail`, priority 10) is the *place* — terrain
  rows (Biome/Height/Tags + the gather module relabeled `Forage:`) and, on a
  food-module tile, the `%ForageAssignControls` "assign foragers" stepper. The
  **Occupants card** (`OccupantsPanel`, priority 12,
  hidden via the dock on an empty hex) is a **selectable roster** of the bands +
  wildlife on the hex, built at runtime into `%RosterList` as two sub-groups
  (`Bands (N)` / `Wildlife (N)`); each row is a `Button` hosting a mouse-transparent
  HBox — a selection accent, a **vitality dot**, name, size, and (bands) an
  activity glyph; a **wildlife** row reads **species + size class** and nothing else
  (`🦌 Red Deer   Big game`). **A detail row never restates what its
  roster row already shows** (the same rule the Band/City panel header follows). The roster
  row IS the identity line — name + size — so every drawer dropped
  the rows that echoed it: band → `Unit` + `Size`; herd → `Herd` / `Species` / `Size`
  (the name appeared three times, the size twice); expedition → `Unit` + `Party` (`Party`
  printed the same `size` field the row's meta shows). **THE FAUNA ID IS A DATABASE KEY AND IS
  NEVER RENDERED** (`game_fowl_27` means nothing to a player and crowded out the two things that
  do). It briefly rode the row as a dim meta on the theory that the command feed named herds by
  it — the right fix was to stop the FEED leaking it (`Main._on_hud_send_hunt_expedition` now
  notes `fauna_label`, the species, while the command line keeps `fauna_id`), not to teach the
  player the key. It stays **data**: the row's `pressed` bind and every `assign_labor` / `tame` /
  `send_hunt_expedition` address the herd by it. Renders of it elsewhere are **fallbacks only**
  (`_herd_display_name` / `_herd_label_for_id` reach for `id` only when species AND label are
  both missing) — never the normal path. What's left in a drawer is only what the row can't show — herd: Biomass / Ecology /
  Husbandry / Corral / Position; expedition: Mission / Target / Policy / Phase / Carried /
  Position. **Expedition `Policy` / `Phase` keep their WORDS** — the compact
  Active-expeditions row is where the glyph vocabulary belongs; the drawer IS the
  disclosure. Below the roster,
  `%OccupantDetail` is the selected occupant's
  **detail drawer** for **herds/expeditions** (`_herd_summary_lines` +
  `%HerdAssignControls`; expedition → `_build_expedition_panel` into
  `%AllocationPanel`). **Player-band detail relocated out of the Occupants card into
  the dockable `BandCityPanel`** (see **Band/City dockable panel** below): the roster
  still lists the band, but its summary + labor allocation render in the panel, not
  the card. Selecting a row (`_on_roster_row_selected`) re-homes the
  selection and emits `roster_occupant_selected(kind, id)`; **Main forwards it to
  `MapView.select_occupant`, which moves the map selection ring** (sets
  `selected_unit_id`/`selected_herd_id`) with no hex click. A fresh tile click
  auto-selects the first occupant through the same path. The **vitality dot is
  unified** across map/roster/drawer: a band's dot uses `BandFoodStatus.color_for_days`
  (`days_of_food` → green/amber/red), a herd's uses `_ecology_tier_color`
  (`ecology_phase` → thriving green / stressed amber / collapsing red), sharing the
  exact `HudStyle` HEALTHY/WARN/DANGER constants. Non-player bands list with a neutral
  dot and no allocation panel (their larder/orders aren't ours to see). (The Tile card
  has no camp action — the `found_camp` command was removed end-to-end.)
- **Labor allocation UI** (`Hud.gd`, Early-Game Labor slice 3b — `docs/plan_early_game_labor.md`):
  the band is a **labor pool** whose working-age workers are assigned source-centrically to
  in-range sources/roles. There is **exactly one player band today**, captured each snapshot
  into `_player_band` (first player-faction cohort in `update_band_alerts`); assign/move/clear
  all target it. Every player band is also collected into `_player_bands`, which backs the
  **band-picker dropdown** on the herd/tile assign controls (see `%HerdAssignControls` /
  `%ForageAssignControls` below) — an assignment explicitly names WHICH band supplies the
  workers (built for N even though only one exists live). Three runtime-built control sets replace the retired single-task Scout/Cancel,
  Hunt/policy, and Forage buttons:
  - **`%AllocationPanel`** (band drawer, player band only, `_build_allocation_panel`): reads as a
    "current actions" report — a `Population <size> · Workers <working_age> (Idle <n>)` line (spells
    out that only the ~16 working-age labor, not the 30 people — children/elders are dependents;
    `WORKERS_HEADER_FORMAT`, idle from `_effective_idle` so it counts optimistically), a
    **Current actions** section with one `−/+` **worker-stepper** row per staffed Forage tile / Hunt
    herd (from the cohort's `labor_assignments`; an empty-state hint when none). **A Forage/Hunt row is
    TWO lines** (the `status_line` opt-in on `_build_worker_stepper` → a `VBoxContainer`; the
    Scout/Warrior role rows and the compose steppers stay the single-line `HBoxContainer`): **line 1** is
    the resource-glyph title + tile/species (`🌰 Forage (27, 26)`) beside the `−/+` stepper, keeping its
    click-to-jump link; **line 2** is an INDENTED, smaller (`ALLOC_SECTION_FONT_SIZE`), `HFlowContainer`
    that WRAPS carrying the yield + policy glyph + status glyph + any ⚠/overstaff/wasted notes
    (`+0.48 /turn  ♻  ●  · only 2 of 5 working`), so the row reads narrow and never forces the panel
    wider. `_build_two_line_stepper` / `_build_row_name_label` / `_build_status_part` /
    `_add_stepper_controls` factor the title/stepper/status parts so both forms share them. **A row
    states its policy and its status as GLYPHS, not words** — the old
    `[sustain]` / `· pending` word-tags were long and, for pending, redundant with the amber tint.
    Both come from the one glyph registry, `FoodIcons` (`for_policy` / `for_status`; see the
    **action-status vocabulary** header block in `Hud.gd`), and the WORDS move into the row tooltip
    (policy name + its existing `FORAGE_POLICY_HINTS`/`LOCAL_HUNT_POLICY_HINTS` behaviour hint — a
    worked source row is always a RESIDENT band's, so the hunt side reads the local set, never
    `SEND_HUNT_POLICY_HINTS`, whose payoffs differ; `_policy_hint` is the one lookup), plus the
    status in words), composed WITH the tooltip the row already carried (yield readout, overstaffing
    explanation, click-to-focus hint). Two orthogonal layers: **status** = what the action is doing
    (a confirmed local forage/hunt row has no sim phase — it is simply `working` `●`), and
    **`pending`** = a state of the ORDER (composed locally, not yet acknowledged; it rides on ANY row,
    is a modifier rather than a phase member, wins the glyph slot with `○`, and keeps the amber label
    tint). The policy glyph is read off the assignment's `policy` field (populated for forage too); an
    an assignment whose policy is unset falls back to no glyph. **Each source row headlines its per-turn food yield**
    (`… +0.31 /turn`, the assignment's `actual_yield`), with a WARN-tinted `⚠` **overdraw flag** when
    `actual > sustainable + ε` (`OVERHUNT_EPSILON`). A Sustain source gathers at its renewable ceiling
    (`actual == sustainable` → no flag, reads `… · renewable`); a Surplus/Market/Eradicate **forage
    patch** or an over-hunted herd pushes `actual` above `sustainable` → the flag trips (forage is no
    longer hardcoded renewable now that the policy axis can decline a patch). A
    `tooltip_text` spells out actual-vs-sustainable. **Each source row also flags overstaffing** — a
    WARN-tinted `· only N of M working` note (`OVERSTAFF_NOTE_FORMAT`) when `workers > workers_needed`
    (and `workers_needed > 0`), i.e. the source's take was capped at its ceiling so the surplus workers
    idled HERE and should be reassigned; the `tooltip_text` (`OVERSTAFF_TOOLTIP`) explains it. This is
    **orthogonal to the ⚠ overdraw flag** and deliberately NOT the same glyph: overdraw is *ecological*
    (taking past regrowth), overstaffing is *labor* (wasted workers) — a source can be overstaffed while
    perfectly sustainable (every policy has a ceiling), or overdrawn while fully used. `workers_needed
    == 0` (rehydrated, or a pending optimistic assign) means "unknown" → no note, never a
    wrong one.
    **ONE yield row per rung — each rung gets the row that informs ITS decision, never both.** On the
    **local hunt** the EXTRACTIVE four render `_local_hunt_preview_bbcode` (the crew's honest carry-aware
    delivered take, ANIMALS-first — `≈1 Red Deer/turn` — PLUS the sustainability verdict `· renewable` /
    `⚠ overdraws the herd`, and a WARN `· ⚠ N% wasted` suffix when a kill can't be carried; see the
    animals-first preview note below) and the INVESTMENT rung (Corral)
    renders `_forecast_yield_row` (`Preparing: +0.23 → then +1.05` — the dip→payoff deal, which a single
    rate structurally cannot express; Corral draws sustainably, so no overdraw verdict is lost).
    **Forage now mirrors the hunt split** — its EXTRACTIVE rungs render `_local_forage_preview_bbcode`
    (the plant twin, a bare rate + `· renewable` / `⚠ … — overdraws the patch`; no animal rhythm, so no
    waste suffix) and only its INVESTMENT rungs (Cultivate/Sow) keep `_forecast_yield_row`. Rendering
    both on a hunt was a merge artifact: the flat `per_worker_yield`/`ceiling_*` scalars and the
    `hunt_policy_ceilings` list are **two views of ONE sim hunt model** and agree numerically (verified:
    both give +0.54 on a Market take — the redundancy was measured before it was removed, not assumed), so
    the second row added no information and **argued with the first** — a HEALTHY-green "Expected yield"
    directly above a WARN-amber "⚠ overdraws the herd" for the same number. (The two overlapping wire
    representations should be collapsed to one server-side; tracked separately.) Both the ⚠ and the note are rendered by `_build_worker_stepper` (`warn` / `note` params)
    off one `_source_yield_readout`, so Forage and Hunt rows share the logic.
    **Each source row leads with its resource glyph** — `FoodIcons.for_site(module)` for a Forage
    row (resolved from `_food_module_by_tile`, the snapshot `food_modules` array pushed by `Main` →
    **`Hud.update_food_modules`**, keyed by tile) and `FoodIcons.for_herd(species)` for a Hunt row —
    the SAME icon the map marker draws, so a source reads identically in the panel and on the map. An
    unresolvable module renders the row bare (no fallback sprig).
    **Each source row's LABEL is clickable — it jumps the map to the source being worked.**
    `_build_worker_stepper`'s optional `on_focus_source` Callable turns the label into an inline link
    Button (`HudStyle.apply_link_button` — plain at rest, hover tint + `SIGNAL` text + pointing-hand
    cursor, a far tighter padding than the boxed ghost chrome); it is a *separate child* from the
    `−`/`+` stepper, which is untouched, and the count stays right-aligned. Both handlers route
    through `_focus_labor_source` — the SAME path the Active-expeditions rows and the turn-orb
    "Jump →" use: `alert_focus_requested` → `MapView.focus_and_select_tile`, plus (herd only)
    `roster_occupant_selected` → `MapView.select_occupant` so the herd's own drawer opens rather than
    whatever occupant the hex auto-selects; `_panel_band` is restored afterwards, so focusing a hex
    that hosts another band can't hijack the panel. **Forage** jumps to the assignment's
    `target_x/target_y` (a patch is a fixed tile). **Hunt** deliberately does NOT — herds MIGRATE, so
    `_focus_hunt_source` resolves the herd's **live** tile from `_world_herds` via `_find_world_herd`
    (the Hud mirror of `MapView._herd_by_id`, which the hunted-herd ring already resolves through),
    falling back to the assignment target only when the herd is unknown. `_world_herds` is the
    snapshot `herds` array, pushed each snapshot by `Main` → **`Hud.update_herds`**; it also backs
    `_herd_label_for_id`'s new fallback, so an off-hex hunted herd reads "Red Deer" instead of the raw
    `game_deer_07` id. **Scout/Warrior are band-wide roles with no tile → plain, non-clickable
    labels.** Verified by `band_panel_preview` state `band_panel_source_row_hover` (the harness
    force-hovers the Hunt link, so the affordance shows in a static frame).
    `actual_yield`/`sustainable_yield`/`workers_needed` are decoded per assignment in
    `native/src/lib.rs` (inside
    `labor_assignments`); the band-level food flow (net rate + Gathered/Hunted/Eaten breakdown) lives
    on the **Food summary line**, not here — see "Band food status". Then a **Band roles**
    section with the always-shown **Scout** + **Warrior** rows (even at 0), each with a one-line hint so
    the `−/+` steppers read as "this is how you staff this standing role" (Scout's hint reads "Extends
    the band's sight — more scouts see further"; more staffed scouts extend the band's actual sight
    range, so the effect shows directly in the fog, not as a map-action or a reveal disc). Then
    **Move** / **Clear all**.
    Each stepper re-sends `assign_labor_requested` with the new count (0 removes); `+` is gated on idle.
  - **Optimistic pending feedback** (slice 3b UX): assigning workers or moving the band shows
    immediately, before the next snapshot. `_emit_assign_labor` / `_try_dispatch_pending_move_band`
    record a HUD-local **pending** entry per band entity (`_pending_labor[entity] = {turn, assign:{key→…},
    move:{x,y}}`) and re-render. In the panel, a pending source row reads **amber with the `○` pending
    glyph** (the words live in its tooltip — "Pending — starts when you advance the turn"; the amber
    stays the primary signal, tying the row to the amber pending hex on the map) and the header
    **Idle** counts optimistically (`_effective_idle` = working-age − effective
    assigned, overlaying pending). **Reconciliation is turn-based:** each pending entry is tagged with the
    snapshot `turn` (header tick, set in `update_overlay`); `_reconcile_pending` (called from
    `update_band_alerts` each snapshot) drops entries issued on an OLDER turn — a newer-turn snapshot is
    authoritative confirmation and cleanly absorbs server-side clamping (the snapshot shows the real
    count). Pending is emitted to MapView via `labor_pending_changed` → `set_labor_pending`.
  - **Selected-band map highlights** (`MapView._draw_band_work_highlights`, drawn when a player band
    is selected, cleared on deselect): the **worked forage tiles** (strong green fill on each
    `forage` assignment's `target_x/y`), the **work-range ring** (thin cyan outline on every tile
    within `work_range`, replicating the sim's true **odd-r hex distance** `hex_distance_wrapped`
    via `MapView._hex_distance` — a real hexagonal ring of 19 tiles at range 2, so highlighted ==
    actually-assignable; the old Chebyshev square wrongly lit its diagonal corners, which are 3
    hex-steps away), and the **hunted
    herds** (red ring on the herd tile + a band→herd link, drawn wherever the herd is since hunt reach
    = `work_range` + leash). **Per-source yield annotations** (`_draw_yield_label`): each staffed forage
    tile / hunted herd is labeled with its `actual_yield` (food/turn, from the assignment inside
    `labor_assignments`) as a small drop-shadow number above the tile center (reusing `_draw_marker_glyph`),
    food-income **green**; a source that overdraws (`actual_yield > sustainable_yield + ε`, reusing the
    panel's overdraw test) reads **WARN amber + a `⚠`** — an over-hunted herd, or a non-Sustain forage
    patch now that the forage policy axis can decline one (a Sustain forage gathers at regrowth, so it
    stays green). The label sits on a **dark rounded banner/pill plate** (`_draw_pill_plate`, the shared
    pill chrome extracted out of `_draw_count_pill` — the `×N`/`+N` badges draw the same primitive):
    bare drop-shadowed text washed out on the light tan biomes (prairie/desert), so the plate is sized to
    the MEASURED text+glyph run plus symmetric padding (`YIELD_LABEL_PLATE_PAD_FACTOR`, a fraction of the
    font size) and centered on the label's existing anchor, near-black + slightly translucent
    (`YIELD_LABEL_PLATE_BG`) so the terrain still reads through. The
    label font scales with the hex radius (clamped) and the whole annotation (plate included) is
    **LOD-suppressed below
    `ICON_MIN_DETAIL_RADIUS`** (like the secondary markers) so far zoom stays clean. Scout/Warrior
    produce no food → no label. **The labels are DEFERRED to the very end of `_draw`** — they are an
    annotation OVER the map, and drawn inline in the highlight pass they were painted over by every
    later layer (the dashed-amber pending overlays, the band→herd links, the hunted-herd rings, and the
    secondary herd/food glyphs — a deer glyph landing squarely on the number). The highlight pass now
    `_queue_yield_label`s each request into `_deferred_yield_labels` (cleared at the top of
    `_draw_band_work_highlights`, before its early-outs) and `_flush_yield_labels()` renders the batch
    as the LAST draw call, after the markers/rings/links/pending/targeting. The LOD gate stays at the
    QUEUE site (`show_yields`), so a far-zoom label is never queued and deferral can't bypass the
    suppression. Guarded by `map_preview` state `map_band_label_overlap` (a herd parked ON a worked
    forage tile + a pending hunt dashing across the hunted herd's label) and `map_band_yield_farzoom`. **Scouting draws no map highlight** — staffed scouts extend the band's
    real sight range (visible directly in the fog as a wider Active radius); the old faint-blue scouted
    disc was removed because `scout_reveal_radius` no longer means a reveal-disc radius — it now carries
    the band's effective sight-range bonus (extra tiles beyond base, `0` when no scouts), which the
    client can't turn into a true ring without the server-side `base_range`. New snapshot fields
    `work_range` / `scout_reveal_radius` are decoded in `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` and flowed
    onto the MapView unit marker in `_rebuild_unit_markers` (alongside `labor_assignments`);
    `scout_reveal_radius` is still carried (it documents the field) but no longer drawn. **Optimistic pending**
    actions for the selected band draw in a distinct **dashed-amber** style (`_draw_band_pending`, fed by
    `set_labor_pending`) — the pending forage tile, the pending hunted herd (dashed ring-hex + dashed
    band→herd link), and the pending move destination (dashed hex + dashed link) — clearly apart from the
    solid confirmed styles, cleared when the snapshot confirms.
  - **Travel destination** (`MapView._draw_travel_destination`, drawn for the selected traveling unit —
    band OR expedition — from `_draw_band_work_highlights`): when the unit reports `is_traveling`, a
    thin cyan line runs from its tile to the destination hex plus a steady (non-pulsing) cyan target
    reticle on it. The target coords (`travel_target_x` / `travel_target_y`, `uint`, `0,0` and ignored
    unless `is_traveling`) are decoded in `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` and flowed onto the
    marker in `_rebuild_unit_markers`. **Wrap-aware:** the target is brought into the band's effective
    column frame via `_wrapped_col_delta`, so the line follows the SHORT (possibly seam-crossing)
    wrapped path the sim actually takes rather than shooting the long way across the map. Only the
    selected unit's destination draws (no clutter). Covered by `marker_field_guard`
    (`travel_target_x`/`travel_target_y`/`is_traveling`) and `map_preview` states `map_travel_band` /
    `map_travel_seam` (seam-crossing) / `map_travel_expedition`.
  - **Band-picker dropdown** (`_build_band_picker`, on BOTH assign controls, above the worker
    stepper so it reads "which band → how many workers"): a `Band:` `OptionButton` listing every
    `_player_bands` cohort by positional name ("Band N", via `_band_display_name`; the cohort has
    no label field), item metadata = the band `entity`. The selection is the **actor band**:
    `_hunt_assign_band` / `_forage_assign_band` hold the picked entity (defaulting to
    `_resolve_assign_band()` when the selected source changes, else persisted across re-renders);
    the worker stepper's cap is that band's `_assignable_hunt_workers` / `_assignable_forage_workers`
    (its `idle_workers` + any it already staffs on that source, so re-editing isn't capped below
    current staffing), and the Assign emit + optimistic pending key off the picked band. Switching
    the dropdown re-caps the stepper and re-renders. Always shown (single-item with one band, so the
    actor is explicit). Lists **all** player bands — in-range filtering (Forage `work_range` / Hunt
    `work_range` + leash) is deferred to the multi-band slice (needs hunt-leash reach in the snapshot).
  - **`%HerdAssignControls`** (herd drawer, huntable herds, `_build_herd_assign_controls`): the
    band-picker, then a **distance-aware** "Assign hunters" **compose** control — a `−/+` worker/party
    count (`_hunt_assign_count`) + a **policy picker** (`_build_policy_picker`, `_hunt_assign_policy`,
    default `sustain`). **The two policy axes are separated BY BRANCH, and the sim enforces it:** a
    **local** hunt offers `HUNT_POLICY_OPTIONS` (the four extractive rungs **+ the `Corral` investment
    rung**, gated by `_hunt_policy_gates`), while a hunting **EXPEDITION** offers only the extractive
    `LABOR_HUNT_POLICIES` — a detached party follows the herd and builds no pen, `send_hunt_expedition`
    REJECTS Corral server-side, and the sim exports no `hunt_trip_estimates` row for it, so a Corral
    ETA could only ever be a lie. The
    **local** branch renders `LOCAL_HUNT_POLICY_HINTS` under the picker (the band's real payoffs:
    Sustain → the herd stays healthy AND, on a thriving herd, **builds husbandry toward livestock**;
    Surplus → more food now, pushes settling; Market → sells the take as trade goods, "trade has little
    effect yet" — deliberately not oversold; Eradicate → denial, no food/husbandry/trade). **These are
    NOT the expedition hints** (`SEND_HUNT_POLICY_HINTS`): an expedition's Hunting arm credits **food
    only** — no husbandry accrual, no trade goods (a known v1 gap, tracked server-side) — so the
    expedition set promises neither, and the two sets must stay separate. `LOCAL_HUNT_POLICY_HINTS`
    also owns the **`corral`** hint (Corral is a local-hunt-only rung) — which must carry all three
    halves of that bargain: the ~25-turn half-yield build, the ladder's best payoff, and the fact that
    **penned animals can't graze, so you feed them from your larder every turn and an underfed herd
    shrinks**, and it is the set `_policy_hint`
    spells out on a worked Hunt row's tooltip. **The hint is rendered per BRANCH, never once above
    both** — one shared line under the picker would promise an expedition player the band's payoffs. The
    button + command switch on the **wrap-aware hex distance** from the **SELECTED band's** own tile
    to the herd vs that band's **`hunt_reach`** (= `work_range` + hunt leash, decoded as `hunt_reach`
    and flowed onto the marker): **within reach** → a `Hunters` stepper + **"Assign Local Hunt"** →
    `assign_labor hunt <herd_id> <policy> <workers>`; **beyond reach** → a `Party` stepper (cap
    `min(idle_workers, max_expedition_party_size)`) + a distance hint + **"Send Hunting Expedition"** →
    `send_hunt_expedition <faction> <band> <party_workers> <fauna_id> <policy>` (emitted directly, no
    herd-targeting step — the herd is already selected). Every part of the decision (distance, reach,
    band-entity target) keys off the band the picker selects, explicitly threaded — never the faction's
    default band. **Both branches show a LIVE forecast above the button** (everything — band, count,
    policy, herd — is known at compose time, and the block re-renders on every stepper tick / policy
    click, so it's live, not a confirmation; missing levers/ceilings → no line, panel otherwise
    unchanged): the **expedition** branch renders the SAME raid line as the targeting banner
    (`_hunt_trip_forecast` → `_hunt_forecast_line_bbcode`, shared — the two entry points can't quote
    different numbers) and gives the **button itself** the verdict (`_style_send_hunt_button`).
    **A hunting expedition is a GREEDY RAID** (server `5a130e0`): it grabs the herd's standing surplus
    above the policy floor in a burst and comes home, so the headline is the **PAYLOAD** — the whole
    animals delivered over the turns it takes: **`delivers ≈8 Wild Boar over ≈16 turns (8 hunting + 8
    travel) · ~32 food`** (`HUNT_FORECAST_DELIVERS_FORMAT` + `HUNT_FORECAST_TRAVEL_BREAKDOWN` +
    `HUNT_FORECAST_FOOD_FORMAT`; `animals` = `HuntTripEstimate.animalsTaken`, food = `animals ×
    HerdTelemetryState.foodPerAnimal`). **`turnsToFill` is HUNTING turns only** (server `3bb9731` — travel
    is NOT in it; the per-herd estimate table is band-agnostic). The client adds the **round-trip TRAVEL**
    itself (`_round_trip_travel_turns`, matching the server launch feed EXACTLY: `ceil(2 × wrap-aware
    hex_distance(band, herd) / band_move_tiles_per_turn)`) and headlines the **total**, spelling the split
    out via `HUNT_FORECAST_TRAVEL_BREAKDOWN` when travel > 0. **SERVER-SIDE WORK REMAINS:**
    `band_move_tiles_per_turn` is a LaborConfig scalar NOT yet echoed onto `PopulationCohortState` nor
    decoded onto the band marker, so travel reads 0 on the live wire today (the readout degrades to the
    hunting turns, never a fabricated travel) — the arithmetic lights up the moment the field ships.
    **WARNED vs BLOCKED — the line that matters:** a **slow** raid (finite `turnsToFill` past
    `viability_warn_turns`) or a **long** raid (`turnsToFill == 0` — ran the whole horizon still
    delivering) is a real tradeoff, so it is WARN-amber `"armed"` + `Send Anyway (≈54 turns)` /
    `Send Anyway (long raid)` and stays **enabled**. A **denial** mission (Eradicate, `delivers_food ==
    false`) likewise stays enabled (`Send (delivers no food)`). The ONE blocked case is **no surplus**
    (`_hunt_trip_no_surplus`: `animalsTaken == 0`) — the herd is at/below the policy's floor, so the raid
    would return empty: a mistake with no upside, so the button is **DISABLED** (`Herd too lean to
    raid`). Party size cannot fix it — **surplus is a property of the HERD, not the party** — so the
    reason (`_hunt_no_surplus_reason` → `SEND_HUNT_NO_SURPLUS_REASON`) names **no alternative size** (the
    old row-scan / `_recommended_party` / step-up-impossible machinery is retired: under the raid model
    every party delivers, and a bigger party takes MORE animals in fewer-or-equal turns, never breaks a
    working trip). `_hunt_estimate_key` is the one definition of the `"<policy>:<workers>"` estimate key,
    shared by the single-cell lookup and the max-useful plateau scan.
    **The party stepper caps at MAX-USEFUL on both branches** (`_expedition_useful_cap`): `animalsTaken`
    PLATEAUS with party size once the herd's surplus (not the pack) binds, so extra hunters past the
    plateau raid no more animals — a table SCAN for the smallest size at which animals stops rising, capped
    there with the SAME "max N useful here — more would be idle" note the local hunt uses
    (`MAX_USEFUL_NOTE_FORMAT`). That closes the silent-idle-hunter gap the whole pass exists for.
    **Picking a policy AUTO-FILLS the crew/party to that policy's max-useful cap** (`_hunt_assign_autofill`,
    a one-shot set only by a policy CLICK, consumed on the next rebuild before the clamp — the "give me
    everything this herd sustains" default that guarantees zero waste + the full rate). Both branches;
    the manual `−/+` stepper is untouched (it never sets the flag).
    The **band-first targeting flow gates identically**: `_try_dispatch_pending_send_hunt_expedition`
    refuses to emit on a no-surplus herd and posts the SAME `_hunt_no_surplus_reason` sentence to the
    command feed, staying in targeting — the click is never silently swallowed
    (mirrors the existing "no huntable herd there" nudge). The **local** branch has no carry cap, so a raid readout is meaningless and
    it instead previews the crew's honest **carry-aware delivered take, ANIMALS-first**
    (`_local_hunt_preview_bbcode` / `_hunt_delivered_and_waste`). A hunt takes WHOLE animals via a
    kill-credit bank, so the crew's raw food throughput
    (`workers × hunt_per_worker_provisions × output_multiplier`, capped by the band's flow ceiling)
    is quantized to the whole bodies it can HAUL: `delivered = min(ceiling, floor(collection ÷
    food_per_animal) × food_per_animal)`. The line reads `≈<delivered ÷ food_per_animal> <animal>/turn`
    (e.g. `≈1 Red Deer/turn`, 2-dp trailing-zero-stripped via `_format_animal_rate`), income-green
    `· renewable` or WARN-amber `⚠ … — overdraws the herd` when the delivered take exceeds the herd's
    Sustain ceiling (the shared `_is_overdraw` test). When the crew can't carry even one whole animal the
    surplus meat rots → a **separate** WARN-amber `· ⚠ N% wasted` suffix (`waste_pct`, its own flag,
    rendered amber even on a green line; overdraw + waste can co-occur). Because the animal rate is a
    long-run average of lumpy whole-animal delivery, EVERY extractive rung shows a **STABLE, always-on
    averaging-WINDOW disclaimer** under the policy picker — `HUNT_AVG_WINDOW_FORMAT`: `This estimate is a
    long-run average over ~<X> turns — you take whole animals, so per-turn delivery varies.` X =
    `_hunt_avg_window_turns(herd, policy)`, derived from the SELECTED policy's raw flow ceiling (NOT the
    crew's current delivered rate), so it is **worker-independent and never blinks out** as the Hunters
    count steps up: `g = ceiling ÷ food_per_animal`; slow/big game (`g < 1`) → `ceil(1/g)` (deer Sustain →
    ~2, mammoth Sustain → ~7), fast game → `ceil(1/frac)`, clamped to `HUNT_WINDOW_MAX_TURNS` (12). Keyed on
    the composed policy (a faster policy averages over a different span), extractive rungs only (an
    investment rung shows a dip→payoff, not a cadence), skipped when the window is unknown (missing
    food_per_animal / ceiling → returns 0). The resident band applies its
    morale/discontent productivity modifier at payout, an expedition does not; when `food_per_animal` is
    unknown the line degrades to the old smoothed `≈ +X /turn · renewable` food line (unchanged). **The
    two branches read DIFFERENT herd fields**
    (see "Hunting expedition" below): the expedition line is a pure LOOKUP into the sim's
    forward-simulated `hunt_trip_estimates` (`HERD_TRIP_ESTIMATES_KEY`, zero client arithmetic — a
    `carryCap / rate` division is WRONG for Surplus/Market), while the local line is carry arithmetic over
    the band's flow ceiling `hunt_policy_ceilings` (`HERD_BAND_CEILINGS_KEY`, via `_hunt_delivered_and_waste`
    / `_hunt_policy_ceiling`; `_hunt_take_rate` still backs the food-line fallback). The ecology/MSY model
    is NEVER re-derived client-side.
    Distance uses Hud-local mirrors of MapView's odd-r `_hex_distance` /
    `_wrapped_col_delta`, fed grid width + wrap via `Hud.set_grid_dimensions` (Main forwards the
    snapshot `grid` key). Compose state re-seeds from current staffing when the selected herd changes.
    Covered by ui_preview states `herd_verbs` (local) / `herd_hunt_expedition` (single far band) /
    `herd_hunt_band_near` + `herd_hunt_band_far` (two bands, one herd — picker flips local↔expedition),
    plus the live-forecast states `herd_hunt_forecast_viable` (Mammoth Sustain: cyan "delivers ≈8 …
    over ≈6 turns" + primary button) / `herd_hunt_forecast_slow` (Red Deer Sustain, 54 turns past the
    warn line → amber "⚠ … — a slow raid" + "Send Anyway (≈54 turns)") / `herd_hunt_forecast_surplus`
    (the SAME Red Deer on Surplus: a deeper floor → more animals, brisk turns) /
    `herd_hunt_forecast_no_surplus` (collapsing Wild Fowl at its floor → animalsTaken 0 → red "too lean
    to raid" + disabled button) / `herd_hunt_forecast_eradicate` (denial → amber "Send (delivers no
    food)", enabled), the RAID + max-useful set `herd_hunt_boar_raid` (the server's measured Wild Boar,
    1 hunter → "delivers ≈5 Wild Boar over ≈7 turns · ~20 food", ascending per-policy compact `≈N` picker
    buttons — glyph + metric, name-in-tooltip) / `herd_hunt_max_useful` (2 hunters → "delivers ≈8 … over ≈8 turns"; a 3rd raids no more, so
    the stepper caps at 2 with "max 2 workers useful here — more would be idle") /
    `herd_hunt_raid_travel` (the SAME boar 8 tiles from a band carrying a move rate → the client adds the
    round trip: "delivers ≈8 Wild Boar over ≈16 turns (8 hunting + 8 travel) · ~32 food", cap still 2) /
    `herd_hunt_no_surplus` (a herd stripped to its floor → 0 animals at every size → disabled "Herd too
    lean to raid") / `herd_hunt_eradicate` (the boar on Eradicate → denial, still enabled), and
    `herd_hunt_local_sustain` /
    `herd_hunt_local_overdraw` (local branch, animals-first: green `≈0.14 Red Deer/turn · renewable` vs
    amber `⚠ ≈0.27 Red Deer/turn — overdraws the herd`), and the carry-aware set
    `herd_hunt_delivered_clean` / `herd_hunt_delivered_waste` / `herd_hunt_automax` /

  - **`%ForageAssignControls`** (Tile card, food-module tiles, `_build_forage_assign_controls`): the
    band-picker, then a sustain/surplus/market/eradicate **policy picker** (`_build_policy_picker`,
    `_forage_assign_policy`, `LABOR_HUNT_POLICIES`, default `sustain`) — carrying the SAME ascending
    per-policy **COMPACT** button metric the local-hunt picker does. **Each button is ONE line:
    `<glyph> <compact-metric>`, NO name** (`[♻ +0.96] [⬆ +1.92] [⇄ +2.88] [💀 +4.80] [🌱 →+1.20] [▦ Sow]`).
    **The picker is a `GridContainer` `POLICY_PICKER_COLUMNS` (3) wide, each button `SIZE_EXPAND_FILL`**, so
    the six-rung forage/local-hunt pickers wrap to **two rows of three** (equal-width, filling the panel
    content width) instead of one over-wide row; the six wide two-line `♻ Sustain / up to +0.90/turn`
    buttons used to overflow, and even the compacted six-in-a-row read too wide docked. A picker with
    `≤ POLICY_PICKER_MAX_SINGLE_ROW` (4) rungs — the 4-rung expedition launch/compose picker — stays a
    **single row** (`grid.columns = options.size()`): a 3+1 grid would strand a lone one-third-width button
    on a second row, and 4 narrow rungs already fit one row. Each `*_policy_takes` helper emits a **`{compact, full}` pair** per policy: the
    bare compact string rides the face, the verbose full string moves to the tooltip. Extractive rungs →
    compact `+0.96` (just `_format_signed(ceiling)`, fed by `_forage_policy_takes` off `_forecast_inputs`),
    full `up to +0.96/turn` (`POLICY_CAP_FORMAT`). INVESTMENT rungs on BOTH pickers → compact `→+1.20`
    (`POLICY_PAYOFF_COMPACT`), full `builds toward +1.20/turn` (`POLICY_PAYOFF_FULL_FORMAT`) — the
    `tended_yield`/`field_yield` (forage) or `pastoral_yield`/`corral_yield` (hunt) they build toward, NOT
    the prep dip, which reads below Sustain and was identical for both hunt rungs (quoting it made
    taming/penning look worse than hunting); a locked rung may still show its payoff, the gate-reason line
    (under the picker) explains the lock. **The name lives ONLY in the tooltip now** — every button's
    `tooltip_text` leads with `<Name> — <full metric>` (`POLICY_TOOLTIP_NAME_FORMAT`, e.g. `Sustain — up
    to +0.96/turn`, `Tame — builds toward +1.20/turn`), and a gated button appends its gate reasons below
    that (so a hover names the rung AND explains any lock; enabled buttons carry the name+metric tooltip
    too). A rung with **no** metric (older snapshot / metric-less gated rung, or the send-expedition launch
    picker that passes no `takes`) falls back to the **name** on the face, so a button is never a lone
    glyph. The selected policy's name still shows in the behaviour-hint line below the picker and in each
    locked rung's gate-reason line — the name is never lost, just off the button face. The three pickers —
    forage / local hunt / expedition — wear an identical face format, only the compact metric differs:
    `+X` (extractive), `→+X` (investment, Cultivate/Sow AND Tame/Corral), `≈N` (expedition raid,
    `EXPEDITION_TAKE_COMPACT`). **Picking a policy AUTO-FILLS the
    foragers to that policy's max-useful cap** (`_forage_assign_autofill`, the forage twin of
    `_hunt_assign_autofill` — a one-shot set only by a policy CLICK, consumed on the next rebuild before the
    clamp; the manual `−/+` stepper never sets it). It carries a
    **forage-appropriate**
    behaviour hint (`FORAGE_POLICY_HINTS` — "gather at the patch's regrowth" etc., NOT the herd-cull
    hints), an "Assign foragers" Foragers `−/+` count (`_forage_assign_count`), and a
    **range-aware** **Forage** button → `assign_labor forage <x> <y> <policy> <workers>` (the policy is
    the optional token the sim accepts before the worker count; the policy persists across re-renders
    and re-seeds from the tile's current forage policy via `_policy_for_forage` when the tile changes).
    Mirrors `%HerdAssignControls`' policy affordance. Foraging is
    **stationary** gathering — there is **no forage-expedition fallback** — so the button gates on the
    **wrap-aware hex distance** from the **SELECTED band's** own tile to the forage tile vs that band's
    **`work_range`** (the plain `workRange` field, NOT `hunt_reach`; already decoded/on the marker):
    **within range** → enabled **Forage**; **beyond range** → the button is **disabled** + an
    out-of-range hint (`"(x,y) is N tiles away — beyond this band's forage range (R)"`), no alternative.
    Reuses the same `_hex_distance_wrapped` / `_band_tile` / grid-dim plumbing and explicit
    selected-band threading as the herd hunt. Covered by ui_preview states `food_tile` (in range) /
    `food_forage_out_of_range` (single far band) / `food_forage_band_near` + `food_forage_band_far`
    (two bands, one tile — picker flips enabled↔disabled).

  - **Cultivate / Sow / Tame / Corral — the FOUR INVESTMENT rungs** (on BOTH assign controls; the
    sim's `FollowPolicy::Cultivate` / `Sow` / `Tame` / `Corral`, and `INVESTMENT_POLICIES` names the
    set). The extractive four take from a wild source; these pay an **up-front cost** — while the
    source is being prepared it yields only its dip ceiling, then steps up a rung. Each ladder runs a
    verb **twice**, one per rung-transition (`docs/plan_intensification_ladder.md` §2):
    *plants:* wild --`cultivate`--> **Tended Patch** --`sow`--> **Field**;
    *animals:* wild --`tame`--> **Pastoral herd** --`corral`--> **Pen**.
    **Kind-specific and the sim rejects the cross pairing**: Cultivate + Sow are forage-only
    (`FORAGE_POLICY_OPTIONS`), Tame + Corral hunt-only (`HUNT_POLICY_OPTIONS`) — and both hunt rungs
    are offered on a **local hunt only** (a detached party follows the herd and builds nothing, so the
    expedition keeps the extractive `LABOR_HUNT_POLICIES`, as does the send-expedition launch picker).
    - **These are POLICIES, not standalone commands.** They ride the existing
      `assign_labor … <policy> <workers>` path, exactly as Cultivate/Corral always have — so `Tame`
      and `Sow` needed **zero** new command wiring. The server *also* exposes convenience verbs
      (`tame <faction> <herd_id>` / `sow <faction> <x> <y>`, which switch the policy on bands already
      working the source), but the client does not use them: the picker composes band + workers +
      policy in one act, and routing through a second verb would fork the emit path.
    - **The husbandry CEILING hides a rung outright; knowledge only greys it.** Both hunt rungs are
      filtered against `HerdTelemetryState.husbandryCeiling` (Grazing 2d-δ): Corral needs `"pen"`,
      Tame needs anything above `"wild"` (and retires once `domestication >= 1` — its meter is full
      and Corral is what's next). Hidden, never greyed, because no amount of knowledge or work will
      ever let you pen a `"pastoral"`-ceiling species — greying it would imply a reachable
      prerequisite. Knowledge = "I know how"; ceiling = "this animal allows it" (§4.2, decoupled).
    - **Disabled-with-reason-AND-remedy, never hidden.** `_build_policy_picker(on_pick, selected,
      options, gates)` renders a gated option **greyed, with every reason in the tooltip (one per
      line) AND spelled out under the row**, so the player discovers the rung and its prerequisites
      *before* acting. `gates` maps **policy → `Array[String]` of reasons** (read only through
      `_gate_reasons`); **1 reason** renders the compact one-liner `🌱 Cultivate — <reason>`, **2+**
      render a `🐄 Corral needs:` header + one indented `· <reason>` bullet each (a reason now carries
      its remedy, so two on one line would not fit).
      **Each reason states what's missing + live progress + the action that fixes it** — naming the
      prerequisite alone told the player a door was locked without saying where the key is. **A reason
      is one of exactly two kinds, and the split is the point** (see the two-meter split above): a
      KNOWLEDGE reason is fixed by **practice** and names the ♻ Sustain glyph (pulled from
      `FoodIcons.POLICY_ICONS`, i.e. literally the button beside it) — `Your people know Penning 45%
      — ♻ Sustain-hunt a tamed herd to learn it`; a SOURCE reason is fixed by that rung's **verb** —
      `This herd is 40% tamed — ◎ Tame it to finish`.
      **THE GATE RESHUFFLE (§4.3) — one knowledge per transition, and the client encodes it in
      `_hunt_policy_gates` / `_forage_policy_gates`** (mirroring the sim's `assign_labor` validation):
      * `Cultivate` ← `cultivation >= 1` **and** a Thriving patch **and NOT already `is_cultivated`** —
        a finished patch retires Cultivate outright (`GATE_REASON_ALREADY_TENDED_FORMAT`, "Already a
        Tended Patch — ♻ Sustain-forage it to harvest"), because re-running the verb only pays the low
        prep dip forever. The completed reason SUPERSEDES the prep prerequisites (a done patch's
        Thriving/knowledge gates are moot). Since a gated rung can never be the composed policy, this is
        also what STOPS the panel lying on a done patch: a standing Cultivate falls back to Sustain, so
        the "Preparing → then" prep line disappears and the forecast reads the Sustain harvest.
      * `Sow` ← `seed_selection >= 1` **and** the ground will take seed (see the Sow site gate below)
        **and NOT already `patch_is_field`** — a finished Field retires Sow the same way
        (`GATE_REASON_ALREADY_FIELD_FORMAT`). Deliberately **no** Thriving gate: sown ground starts at
        the reseed floor (i.e. Collapsing), so a health gate would forbid the very case the rung exists for.
      * `Tame` ← `herding >= 1`. **Herding gates Tame ALONE now** — it no longer gates Corral.
      * `Corral` ← **`penning >= 1`** (the new rung-3 knowledge) **and** `domestication >= 1`.
      Two more remedies are the *opposite* of "work harder", because their conditions are stocks, not
      policies: the **patch-ecology** gate (a fully staffed Sustain takes the whole regrowth and holds
      a Stressed patch Stressed forever) reads `Patch is Stressed — ease workers off and let it regrow
      to Thriving`; and `_tame_stalled_hint` (below) says the same of a stalled tame. A gated rung can
      never be the composed policy (re-validated every render, since a source can leave Thriving under
      a standing selection). **Known gap (pre-existing):** `_hunt_policy_gates` does NOT check herd
      **ownership** — the tracks are per-faction, so a herd tamed by ANOTHER faction reads as
      available client-side while the sim rejects the assign.
    - **`_tame_stalled_hint` — the one silent rule, said out loud.** Taming accrues only while the
      herd is **Thriving**, but that is deliberately NOT a gate: a herd's phase swings as it is
      hunted, so refusing the verb would be un-actionable churn. The sim just **pauses** the meter
      (progress is neither lost nor switched). Silence would recreate exactly the hidden-rule problem
      this arc exists to kill, so whenever `Tame` is composed on a non-Thriving herd the drawer states
      the pause, its live phase, that progress is safe, and the ease-off remedy (WARN amber).
      ui_preview `herd_tame_stalled`.
    - **The Sow SITE gate — the refusal is an ANSWER, not a bool.** Only ~**46 of 4160** tiles (1.1%)
      will take seed, so "why can't I sow here?" is *the* question rung 3 provokes — and the client
      **cannot re-derive** it (no per-biome capacity table, no hydrology). The sim ships the verdict
      as a stable key on `ForagePatchState.sowSiteRefusal` (`""` / `too_poor` / `too_dry` /
      `too_poor_and_too_dry`), resolved through the same `RungSiteRequirement::refusal` seam the `sow`
      command gates on, and `_sow_site_refusal_reason` maps it to `SOW_REFUSAL_REASONS` — each naming
      the fault AND pointing at rung 4 (Worked Land — irrigation/the plough), in the manual's voice.
      An **unknown key still refuses** (fail closed: the sim gates the command regardless, so a button
      offered here would only fail unreadably). This is the only gate reason on either ladder a player
      answers by **moving** rather than by working. ui_preview `forage_sow_too_dry` /
      `forage_sow_too_poor`.
    - **The forecast states the deal.** `_forecast_inputs` maps an investment policy's ceiling to the
      DIP yield and additionally returns its `payoff`; `_forecast_yield_row` (now INVESTMENT-only) then
      reads **`Preparing: +0.24 /turn → then +1.20 /turn`** — the deal, not a single rate — both halves
      scaled by the band's `output_multiplier` like every other forecast. The managed source reports
      per-worker == ceiling, so the stepper caps at **1 worker**, as it should.
      **Corral's payoff is GROSS** (`corralYield` does NOT deduct the pen's feed), so its row never
      shows the payoff bare (`FORECAST_FEED_KEYS`, the rungs with a running cost — Corral only; a
      tended patch has none): `Preparing: +0.75 /turn → then +5.40 /turn − 1.74 feed`. `penUpkeep` is
      **one field with one meaning on both sides of the decision** — the feed this pen demands, *or
      would demand once built*, at the herd's current biomass, on the SAME basis `corralYield` uses —
      so the subtraction is a pure difference of two numbers the sim exported for THIS herd and the
      client models no ecology. (It is **demanded**, not paid: the *paid* figure is the cohort's
      `penFeedUpkeep`, and `penFedFraction` is their ratio. Don't cross the wires.)
      **A ZERO PAYOFF IS DATA — it must never be suppressed.** The pen harvests by constant
      escapement, so a herd at/below `K/2` honestly pays **+0.00** until it rebuilds: penning it would
      eat feed forever and pay nothing. The row renders both zeros in full and **emphasizes** them —
      WARN-amber plus `⚠ Too depleted to pen — it would eat feed and pay nothing until the herd
      rebuilds` (`INVESTMENT_FORECAST_DEPLETED_NOTE`) — rather than blanking the 0 as "no data". A
      player who pens a depleted herd because the UI declined to show them a zero has been actively
      misled. ui_preview `herd_corral_depleted`.
    - **TAME's dip has no scalar ceiling field — its DIP rides the list, its PAYOFF is a scalar.** There
      is no flat `ceilingTame` on the wire (the Tame dip rides the `huntPolicyCeilings` LIST, so `tame`
      has **no** `FORECAST_CEILING_KEYS` entry — adding one would silently fall back to Sustain's ceiling
      and quote the wrong dip); `_forecast_inputs` resolves Tame's dip through `_hunt_policy_ceiling`
      instead. The PAYOFF, by contrast, IS a real scalar: `HerdTelemetryState.pastoralYield` (the
      pastoral MSY once tamed, the twin of `corralYield`), decoded as `pastoral_yield` and mapped in
      `FORECAST_PAYOFF_KEYS` → so Tame is a full investment rung (`forecast["investment"] == true`) and
      renders the SAME dip→payoff row as Cultivate/Sow/Corral: `Preparing: +<dip> → then +<pastoralYield>`
      (no feed term — Tame has no running cost). `INVESTMENT_POLICIES` still names the set (an investment
      rung must never fall through to the extractive `renewable / ⚠ overdraws` preview), and both hunt
      investment rungs' picker buttons wear the `→ +Y/turn` PAYOFF (Tame `→ pastoralYield`, Corral
      `→ corralYield`) via `_hunt_policy_takes` — NOT the during-building dip, which reads below Sustain
      and was identical for both, making taming/penning look worse than hunting. The payoff shows even on
      a gated/greyed rung (the gate-reason line explains the lock). ui_preview `herd_tame` /
      `two_meter_split` (gated Corral still quotes its payoff).
    - **Progress meters — one row per rung, never merged.** Tile card: `Cultivation N%` → `🌾 Tended
      Patch`, joined by its own **`Field`** row — `Sowing N%` → the SIGNAL-tinted **`▦ Field`**
      (`patch_field_progress` / `patch_is_field`, `_field_label` / `_field_value_hex`). Herd drawer:
      `Husbandry: Domesticating N%` → `🐄 Domesticated`, joined by `Corral: Building N%` → `🐄
      Corralled`. **A patch carries BOTH plant meters at once** (a Field may stand on ground that was
      never tended — seed travels, so `Sow` needs no prior patch), so they are two independent rows.
      A completed **Field** deliberately reads as a *different thing* from a Tended Patch — different
      word, different glyph — not as a bigger percentage; that IS rung 3's readout test.
      `Sowing`/`Building`/`Fencing` share one build-verb convention.
    - **Knowledge-unlock nudge.** `_ingest_intensification` keeps the per-faction tracks (all four,
      driven off `KNOWLEDGE_TRACK_LABELS` — adding a rung's knowledge is a label entry + a decoder
      field, never an edit there) and fires a ONE-SHOT `KNOWLEDGE_UNLOCK_NOTES` command-feed note the
      turn a track crosses to complete. Only a real `<1 → >=1` transition fires it (a track already
      complete on first snapshot / a rehydrated save is silent), player faction only, keyed per
      faction+track.
    - **Wire fields decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`** (snapshot + delta share `herds_to_array` /
      `forage_patches_to_array`). **This decoder has now FOUR times silently dropped appended fields
      — check it FIRST when a new field "arrives as zero".** `ForagePatchState`: `ceilingCultivate` /
      `tendedYield` → `patch_ceiling_cultivate` / `patch_tended_yield`, and the five slice-6a fields
      `fieldProgress` / `isField` / `ceilingSow` / `fieldYield` / `sowSiteRefusal` →
      `patch_field_progress` / `patch_is_field` / `patch_ceiling_sow` / `patch_field_yield` /
      `patch_sow_site_refusal` (MapView cross-refs all onto `tile_info` with the `patch_` prefix; ALL
      are in `FOW_DISCOVERED_HIDDEN_KEYS`, mirroring their rung-2 twins). `HerdTelemetryState`:
      `ceilingCorral` / `corralYield` / `corralProgress` / `domestication` / `huntPolicyCeilings`
      (which carries a **6th `tame` row** — the sim exports one per `FollowPolicy::HUNT_POLICIES`) +
      **`bodyMass` → `body_mass`** (a real appended field, the 4th drop; BIOMASS, surfaced for
      completeness — it **cannot** drive the rhythm, see below) and **`foodPerAnimal` →
      `food_per_animal`** (slot 72, the food-unit quantity the rhythm actually divides by) and
      **`pastoralYield` → `pastoral_yield`** (the newest slot — Tame's payoff, the pastoral twin of
      `corralYield`, which lets Tame render `→ +Y`; verified present on the herd dict) → bare keys
      on the herd dict. `LaborAssignment`: `actualYield` / `sustainableYield` / `workersNeeded` +
      **`wastedYield` → `wasted_yield`** (the understaffing signal, also dropped) → per-assignment keys
      inside `labor_assignments`. `IntensificationKnowledgeState`: `cultivation` / `herding` +
      slice-4's `seedSelection` / `penning` → `seed_selection` / `penning` (present — the "Penning 0%"
      playtest report was NOT a decoder drop; see the kill-rhythm/knowledge notes below).
    - **The hunt row headlines the honest RATE, never the kill-credit PULSE** (`Hud._source_yield_readout`,
      slice 8b UX + the local-hunt UX cleanup): a Current-actions Hunt SUMMARY row + the local-hunt preview
      show `sustainable_yield` (the smoothed per-turn take), not `actual_yield` (0 on a wait turn, a spike on
      a kill turn — the "+0.00 /turn" lie). **The summary row is now JUST the food rate + glyphs** — it reads
      `Hunt <species> +X /turn ♻ ●` (food rate, policy glyph, status glyph). The **animals-per-turn cadence
      (`≈<rate> <animal>/turn`) belongs to the COMPOSE-PREVIEW line only** (`_local_hunt_preview_bbcode` /
      `_format_animal_rate` — `sustainable_yield ÷ food_per_animal`, up to 2 dp, trailing zeros stripped;
      fast game `≈1.3 Marsh Fowl/turn`, big game `≈0.15 Woolly Mammoth/turn`): on a summary row the food rate
      is enough, so the cadence suffix was dropped there (the old `_hunt_row_animal_rate` / `HUNT_RHYTHM_SEPARATOR`
      helpers are gone). The **old fast/slow flip** (`_hunt_kill_rhythm`'s `≈1 Mammoth / N turns` slow form)
      had already been retired — its jarring format switch confused the reading. **The preview cadence divides
      FOOD by FOOD** — the rate (`sustainable_yield`, provisions) by **`food_per_animal`**
      (`HerdTelemetryState.foodPerAnimal`, slot 72 = `body_mass × provisions_per_biomass` = the sim's
      `SourceYieldForecast::body_mass_yield`, one animal's worth of yield in provisions). It must **NOT**
      divide by `body_mass` (BIOMASS): with `provisions_per_biomass 0.02` that reads ~50× too long. A herd
      whose `foodPerAnimal` is 0/unknown → no cadence drawn (the honest rate still shows). The **hunt policy
      picker** (`_build_policy_picker(…, takes)`, fed
      `_hunt_policy_takes` off `huntPolicyCeilings`) shows each rung's **CAP** as the bare compact `+X` on
      the button face (full `up to X/turn` — `POLICY_CAP_FORMAT` — in the tooltip; the shared const also
      used by the forage picker — the source's worker-independent ceiling, FOOD units, distinct from the
      crew's carry-aware per-turn preview line below the picker) so Sustain < Surplus < Market < Eradicate
      reads as ASCENDING. `wasted_yield > 0` renders a muted "· N.N wasted" understaffing note (the low-key
      mirror of the WARN overstaff note). A MANAGED
      (corralled/pastoral, or composing-Corral) herd's local crew are **Herders**, not Hunters
      (`_is_managed_hunt_source` → the stepper + "Assign …" title noun), since `workersNeeded` there is
      the herding crew (max herders, haulers), not a hunt party. The in-progress Cultivation tile-card
      row leads with the **"Preparing N%"** build-verb, matching the herd's "Domesticating N%".

      SUMMARY rows — each `Hunt <species> +X /turn ♻ ●` with NO `≈… /turn` animals-per-turn cadence; the

      `forage_sow_done` (a completed Field: ▦ Sow greys "Already a Field …" the same way, one rung up).
  - **Pre-commit yield forecast** (on BOTH assign controls): setting up a forage/hunt assignment used
    to give no feedback — you staffed 6 workers, committed, advanced a turn, and only then learned 5
    were wasted. The sim now streams, with **identical field names** on `ForagePatchState` and
    `HerdTelemetryState` (`perWorkerYield` / `ceilingSustain` / `ceilingSurplus` / `ceilingMarket` /
    `ceilingEradicate` — all food/turn at the source's **current biomass**, exported at
    `output_multiplier = 1.0`), enough to compute the take *while composing*:
    `expected(workers, policy) = min(workers × per_worker_yield, ceiling[policy])` (the ceilings are
    already biomass-clamped, so that `min` IS the take) and `max_useful_workers(policy) =
    ceil(ceiling[policy] / per_worker_yield)`. Decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
    (`herds_to_array` bare / `forage_patches_to_array`, both the snapshot + delta paths), carried to
    the controls via the herd dict and — for the patch — via `forage_patch_lookup` → `_tile_info_at`
    as `patch_`-prefixed keys (in `FOW_DISCOVERED_HIDDEN_KEYS`, so a remembered tile redacts them).
    Two affordances, both recomputed on **every** stepper *and* policy change (both already re-render
    the controls): a live forecast line (scaled by the **selected band's `output_multiplier`** — the sim
    exports at 1.0), and a **worker-stepper cap** of
    `min(idle-worker cap, max_useful_workers(policy))` — the `+` goes dead at the cap and, when
    max-useful is the binding one, a `"max N worker(s) useful here — more would be idle"` note
    explains why (a Market/Eradicate ceiling exceeds Sustain's, so switching policy moves the cap).
    **When the *labor* cap binds instead** (idle workers run out *below* the usefulness ceiling), the
    silent-disable case is filled by a companion note — `LABOR_BOUND_NOTE_FORMAT` = `"N of M useful —
    free up idle workers to send more"` (M = the usefulness ceiling, so it tracks the selected policy;
    the expedition's party-size sub-case, `idle >= max_party_size`, reads `PARTY_SIZE_BOUND_NOTE_FORMAT`
    = "N of M useful — at the max party size"). The cap value is unchanged (still `min(labor,
    usefulness)`); only the note now names *which* ceiling bound and the M you're working toward, so a
    disabled `+` is never mute. (`_expedition_useful_cap` scans the full estimate table for M even past
    the fieldable party, so "of M" can exceed the party you can currently staff.)
    **ONE forecast row per rung, and forage now mirrors the local hunt exactly** (`Hud.gd`): an
    **INVESTMENT** rung (Cultivate/Sow — the `_forage_assign_policy in INVESTMENT_POLICIES` branch)
    keeps `_forecast_yield_row`'s dip→payoff deal (`Preparing: +X /turn → then +Y /turn`); an
    **EXTRACTIVE** rung renders `_local_forage_preview_bbcode` — the plant twin of
    `_local_hunt_preview_bbcode` — a bare rate + verdict (`+2.74 /turn · renewable`, or WARN-amber
    `⚠ … — overdraws the patch` on Market/Eradicate via `_is_overdraw` against the Sustain-ceiling
    yield), through the SAME `_forecast_label` RichTextLabel at `ALLOC_SECTION_FONT_SIZE` the hunt line
    uses. This retires the old `"Expected yield:"` prefix for extractive forage (`FORECAST_LABEL_FORMAT`
    is gone and `_forecast_yield_row`'s non-investment `else` branch was unreachable and removed — its
    only two callers, hunt via `forecast_active` and forage via the `INVESTMENT_POLICIES` guard, both
    gate on an investment rung) and fixes the gap where an Eradicate/Market forage rendered no overdraw
    warning. Shared helpers `_forecast_inputs` / `_max_useful_workers` / `_expected_yield` /
    `_forecast_worker_cap` / `_forecast_yield_row` (investment-only now) serve both controls. **Guards:**
    `per_worker_yield == 0` (a dead-season tile) → no row,
    no cap, never a divide-by-zero; a **tended patch / corralled herd** reports every ceiling ==
    `per_worker_yield` ⇒ max-useful 1, policy irrelevant. Applied to the **local hunt only** — an
    expedition accumulates toward a carry cap over several turns of travel, so the herd's per-turn
    ceiling is not the bound on its party size. The **post-hoc** `"· only N of M working"` overstaffing
    note on the allocation rows stays: it still covers a source whose biomass FELL after you staffed
    it. ui_preview: `food_tile` / `forage_forecast_cap` / `tended_tile` / `herd_hunt_band_near`.

  All emit `assign_labor_requested(payload)` (payload: `faction/band/kind/workers/x/y/herd_id/policy`);
  `Main._on_hud_assign_labor` formats the `assign_labor …` text command. **Clear all** emits
  `cancel_order_requested` (the repurposed `cancel_order` = clear-all → fully idle). The roster
  glyph keeps reading the still-populated `activity` (now the largest-worker
  kind: `idle|forage|hunt|scout|warrior`) and `hunt_mode`. `harvestTask`/`scoutTask` are always
  null server-side and no longer decoded. **Convenience shortcut:** double-clicking a herd on the
  map (`MapView.herd_quick_hunt_requested` → `Main._on_map_herd_quick_hunt` → `Hud.quick_assign_hunters`)
  assigns the player band's idle workers to hunt that herd at Sustain — a no-op with a command-feed
  note when there are no idle workers (never silently nothing).
- **Fog gate on live tile contents — "nothing here" ≠ "I can't see what's here"** (`MapView.gd` +
  `Hud.gd`). Herd MARKERS were always Active-gated (`_draw_herd`), but the herd **lookup** wasn't:
  `_herds_on_tile` matched by coordinate with no visibility test, so a fogged hex listed its herds in
  the Occupants roster, let you target them for a hunt, and fed them into the trip forecast.
  - **MapView (source of truth):** `_herds_on_tile` now early-returns on `not _is_tile_visible(col,row)`
    — the SAME gate the renderer uses. It's the single chokepoint (roster / herd-selection click /
    hunt-target click / forecast all read herds through `_tile_info_at` → `tile_info.herds`), so
    "you can only hunt and forecast what you can see" is true by construction. Three sibling leaks
    closed with it: `_herd_at_point` (double-click quick-hunt could hit an undrawn marker), the
    `need == "herd"` targeting glow in `_draw_targeting` (it haloed every huntable herd, fogged ones
    included — the halo WAS the leak), and the `selection_payload` re-resolve of `selected_herd_id`
    (a selected herd that WALKS into fog kept streaming live biomass/ecology + a live forecast; it now
    drops with its marker and the hex falls back to the tile card). **The server still exports every
    herd unfiltered — a wire-level leak tracked separately — so this client gate is LOAD-BEARING, not
    cosmetic. Never read `herds` by coordinate without it.**
  - **Units — same rule, plus the ownership exception** (`_unit_hidden_by_fog`, the ONE definition):
    `hidden == tile not currently visible AND the unit is not ours`. **Your own units are ALWAYS shown,
    including on an Unexplored hex** — that exception is load-bearing, not a courtesy: the sim excludes
    expeditions from fog reveal (`calculate_visibility` runs `Without<Expedition>` — discovery is
    comm-range gated), so a scouting party ROUTINELY stands on an Unexplored tile, and a plain
    visibility gate would erase your own expedition from the map exactly while you're using it. Applied
    at all five leaks: **`_draw_primary_bands`** (had NO gate — foreign bands rendered straight through
    the fog; the worst of them), `_units_on_tile` (roster/click/stack-cycling chokepoint),
    `_unit_at_point` (marker hit-test), `_nearest_unit_sample` (leaked a hidden band's label *and* a
    bearing on it into `tile_info`), and `refresh_selection_payload`'s selected-unit re-resolve (a
    foreign band walking into fog kept streaming live state — now drops its selection, mirroring the
    herd rule). Already-correct (left alone): everything player-scoped — `_draw_supply_links`,
    `_selected_player_band`, the `need == "band"` targeting glow, band alerts, own work highlights.
    Hud mirrors the exception in `_assemble_roster` (an unseen hex lists your own units, never foreign
    ones, and no herds) and appends `OCCUPANTS_UNSEEN_OTHERS_HINT` ("Out of sight — you can't see
    anything here but your own.") so a lone own-party row never implies the hex is otherwise empty.
    ui_preview: `tile_sight_own_expedition` (the regression guard — own expedition on Unexplored still
    listed + selectable + Move/Recall) / `tile_sight_foreign_hidden` / `tile_sight_foreign_visible`.
  - **Hud (says the truth):** the Tile card leads with a **`Sight:` row** — `In sight` (SIGNAL cyan) /
    `Remembered — not in sight now` / `Unexplored` (both INK_DIM; it states what you KNOW, so it never
    borrows the WARN/DANGER palette) — via `_tile_sight_line` + `_sight_value_hex`. On an unseen hex,
    `_tile_contents_unseen` (which re-reads MapView's `visibility_state` flag — NOT a second visibility
    test) makes `_assemble_roster` list nothing, `_build_forage_assign_controls` offer nothing, and
    `_render_occupants_unknown` replace the roster with the honest statement (`Occupants · out of sight`
    + "You remember the ground here, but not what's on it now — bands and herds move. Scout it to see."
    / "Nobody has been here…"). An EMPTY roster is a claim of emptiness the client can't back up, so it
    is never rendered on a hex you can't see. Terrain rows stay (geography is remembered knowledge;
    occupants are live state). ui_preview states `tile_sight_active` / `tile_sight_remembered` (fixture
    deliberately carries a herd → proves it is NOT listed) / `tile_sight_unexplored`.
- **Herd ecology readout** (`Hud.gd` `_herd_summary_lines`): the selection panel shows
  the group's `ecology_phase` (snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.ecologyPhase`) as an
  **Ecology** row — a neutral "Thriving", or a warned "⚠ Stressed" / "⚠ Collapsing"
  that `_format_detail_bbcode` tints amber / red (`_ecology_value_hex`, `HudStyle.WARN_HEX`
  / `DANGER_HEX`). A `Collapsing` herd has been overhunted past the point of no return and
  is crashing to local extinction (see `core_sim` Fauna & Wild Game — depensation collapse).
- **Herd grazing range + carrying capacity** (Grazing Phase 2b-iii; `docs/plan_grazing_2b.md` §8,
  `core_sim` Phase 2b-ii — K becomes ecological): make the ecological carrying-capacity model
  *visible*, so the player sees WHY a herd is the size it is. Two wire fields on `HerdTelemetryState`
  (appended after `penFedFraction`), decoded in `native/src/lib.rs herds_to_array` (both snapshot +
  delta share it): **`carryingCapacity`** → `carrying_capacity` (the herd's CURRENT derived K, what it
  caps at on its range) and **`grazeRangeRadius`** → `graze_range_radius` (the hex radius of its
  grazing range: small game 0, big game 1, migratory = its loiter_radius). Surfaced two ways:
  - **Herd drawer rows** (`Hud._herd_summary_lines`): the **`Biomass`** row carries the herd's CURRENT
    head vs the K its range supports as a **`current / max` pair** — **`Biomass: 1480 / 2150`** — the
    same convention the forage patch (`Forage biomass: 84 / 120`) and the tile card (`Pasture: 236 /
    240`) use, so a herd reads like the other food stocks. The old standalone `Carrying cap: ~K` row was
    merged INTO it and removed; the `~` is dropped because a `current / max` pair already implies the max
    is the derived ceiling. A separate **`Range: N tiles`** row stays (the ground the herd grazes — the
    hex-disk count `1 + 3r(r+1)` via `_graze_range_label`: radius 0 → "Range: 1 tile" singular, 1 → 7, 2
    → 19; the SAME count the map ring draws; key ≤ 16 chars so `_split_detail_kv` aligns it as a table
    row beside Biomass). **Overgrazing is a FEATURE of the pair:** an overgrazed herd has `biomass > K`,
    so the row honestly reads `current > max` (e.g. **`Biomass: 2100 / 1352`**), and when `biomass >
    carrying_capacity × (1 + OVERGRAZE_EPSILON)` a WARN-amber full-width **`⚠ Overgrazing — range can't
    sustain this herd`** row appears beneath (a `_format_detail_bbcode` branch tinting the sentence with
    the shared `HudStyle.WARN_HEX` — NOT a parallel styling path). The ⚠ row carries the overgrazing
    signal; the merged value is deliberately left un-tinted (tinting it too was rendered and rejected as
    a noisy double-up). This is a **trivial honest comparison of two sim-provided numbers**, never a
    re-derivation of the ecology model (K and graze flow are the sim's). **Guards:** `carrying_capacity
    <= 0` (a herd momentarily on barren range derives K = 0) falls back to the bare `Biomass: X` (never
    `X / 0`) and suppresses the overgrazing test; a **corralled** herd (doesn't roam-graze a range)
    suppresses the Range row + overgrazing test entirely (its K is a frozen pen-time value), but keeps
    the merged `Biomass: X / Y` pair.
  - **Map range ring** (`MapView._draw_herd_range_highlights`, drawn from `_draw` when a herd is
    selected, under the herd markers): the tiles within `graze_range_radius` of the herd — the EXACT
    ring the sim grazes / derives K over — as a warm graze-amber FILLED region + gold tile outlines
    (`HERD_RANGE_FILL` / `HERD_RANGE_OUTLINE`), deliberately DISTINCT from the band work-range ring's
    faint cyan (a herd's range is a different thing, and both can be on at once) and readable over the
    Pasture overlay (so the ring sits on the actual graze). Reuses the band ring's odd-r `_hex_distance`
    / `_band_effective_col` (seam-wrapped) / `_fill_hex` / `_outline_hex` primitives. `graze_range_radius
    == 0` (small game) → the herd's own single tile. A **corralled** herd draws nothing. Fog-gated via
    `_is_tile_visible` like the herd marker.
  - Verify: ui_preview `herd_grazing_healthy` (`Biomass: 1480 / 2150`, current < max, no warning) /
    `herd_overgrazing` (`Biomass: 2100 / 1352`, current > max → the ⚠ row) / `herd_grazing_small_game`
    (radius 0 → "Range: 1 tile") / `herd_domesticated` (the penned case: `Biomass: X / Y` with NO Range
    row and no ⚠); map_preview `map_pasture_herd_range` (the gold ring over the Pasture overlay).
- **Clear-all / move-band** (`Hud.gd`, Early-Game Labor slice 3b): the single-task
  Scout/Cancel affordance + its optimistic `_pending_transition_bands` machinery were
  **retired** with the labor-allocation model. There is no longer a band-global task to
  cancel — you staff a source down to 0 (`assign_labor … 0`). The **Clear all** button on
  `%AllocationPanel` emits `cancel_order_requested`; `Main._on_hud_cancel_order` sends the
  **repurposed** `cancel_order <faction> <band_bits>` (now clears ALL assignments → fully
  idle). **Move band** is the one remaining targeting flow: the panel's **Move** button
  (`_on_move_band_pressed`) enters tile-targeting (`_pending_move_band` → `_current_targeting_info`
  returns `command: "move", need: "tile"`), the top-centre banner reads "MOVE … click a
  destination tile", and the destination click (`_try_dispatch_pending_move_band`, via
  `show_tile_selection` / `notify_hex_selected`) emits `move_band_requested(payload)` →
  `Main._on_hud_move_band` → `move_band <faction> <band> <x> <y>`. Esc/right-click cancel
  via `cancel_active_targeting` → `_cancel_pending_move_band`.
- **Herd husbandry readout** (`Hud.gd` `_herd_summary_lines`): when a herd's
  `domestication` (snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.domestication`, 0–1) is above 0, a
  **Husbandry** row shows "Domesticating N%" while it's being tamed and "🐄 Domesticated"
  (SIGNAL tint via `_husbandry_value_hex`) once fully domesticated. This is the **per-source** half
  of the two-meter split — THIS herd's own meter (see "The Intensification Ladder" below). Progress
  builds while a band works the herd under the **`Tame`** policy (and pauses, without loss, whenever
  the herd is not Thriving — surfaced by `_tame_stalled_hint`). **NOT under Sustain**, and there is
  no `domesticate` command: both were retired by the ladder arc (`docs/plan_intensification_ladder.md`
  §4.1) — taming as a hidden Sustain side effect, with a visible-but-disabled `Corral` beside it, is
  the exact UX problem that arc exists to fix. See `core_sim` Fauna & Wild Game — Domestication /
  husbandry.
- **Herd staffing / "Herders" row — the under-herded deficit made VISIBLE** (`Hud.gd`
  `_herd_summary_lines`; snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.herdersNeeded` / `herdedFraction` → decoded in
  `native/src/lib.rs herds_to_array` as `herders_needed` (int) / `herded_fraction` (float)). A managed
  herd needs `herders_needed` herders every turn to HOLD its tameness; understaffed (`herded_fraction <
  1`) its domestication decays, it slips back to WILD, and stops earning Penning — the silent stall a
  playtest hit ("🐄 Domesticated" with no signal Penning had stopped). Immediately after the Husbandry
  row, ONLY when `herders_needed > 0` (0 = wild/unmanaged, `herded_fraction` defaults to `FULLY_HERDED`
  = 1.0 = "no problem"), a **Herders** row shows a calm `N / N` when fully staffed (neutral ink) or an
  amber `A / N — under-herded` (`assigned = round(herded_fraction · needed)`) when slipping, tinted via
  `_herders_value_hex` (WARN, the shared overgrazing/pen-debit path). When under-herded AND
  `domestication > 0`, a muted consequence line — `Tameness slipping — teaching Herding, not Penning.
  Staff all N herders to hold it.` — states WHY Penning stalled and the one lever that fixes it. The
  honest-label choice: the Husbandry label is LEFT as-is (0.98 still reads "Domesticating 100%") — the
  new Herders + consequence lines carry the warning. ui_preview `herd_fully_herded` (calm `4 / 4`) /
  `herd_under_herded` (amber `2 / 4 — under-herded` + the slipping line, Husbandry 98%). **Server half
  (`herdersNeeded`/`herdedFraction` on `HerdTelemetryState`) already landed** — this is the client
  consumer.
- **Per-species husbandry ceiling — gate the ladder by species** (Grazing 2d-δ,
  `docs/plan_grazing_2d.md` §4a; snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.husbandryCeiling` → `husbandry_ceiling`,
  decoded in `native/src/lib.rs herds_to_array` beside `ecology_phase`). Not every animal climbs the
  whole ladder — the string says how far this species can go: **`"wild"`** hunt-only, **`"pastoral"`**
  tameable + roams but never pennable, **`"pen"`** (or **empty/absent** ⇒ treated as pen) the full
  ladder. `Hud._husbandry_ceiling(herd)` normalizes it (unknown → `"pen"`, so an un-tagged herd behaves
  exactly as before the field shipped). Two gates, both keyed off it:
  - **Herd drawer** (`_herd_summary_lines`): `"wild"` shows **no** husbandry track at all (no
    domestication / corral / pen rows), just the dim `Wild game — hunt only` hint; `"pastoral"` keeps
    the domestication (Husbandry) row but replaces the whole corral/pen readout with the dim `Herdable,
    not pennable` hint; `"pen"` renders the full ladder. The hints are colon-free, so
    `_format_detail_bbcode` renders them as dim informational sentences.
  - **Assign controls** (`_build_herd_assign_controls`): the **Corral** rung is filtered OUT of the
    local-hunt policy picker for any non-`"pen"` species (`.filter`, so `HUNT_POLICY_OPTIONS` is
    untouched) — an OUTRIGHT hide, not a greyed "learn Herding" gate, because penning is *impossible*
    for the species, not merely unlearned. The Extend-pen action is implicitly gated (it only shows on a
    `corralled` herd, which is pen-ceiling by construction).
  ui_preview: `herd_ceiling_wild` (hunt-only, no husbandry track + hint, no Corral policy) /
  `herd_ceiling_pastoral` (domestication kept, "Herdable, not pennable", no Corral policy) —
  the existing `herd_*` states carry no ceiling → the unchanged pen path.
- **Herd corral readout** (`Hud.gd` `_herd_summary_lines`): when a herd's `corralled`
  (snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.corralled`, decoded beside `domestication` in
  `native/src/lib.rs herds_to_array`) is true, a **Corral** row shows "🐄 Corralled"
  (SIGNAL tint). The herd end of the intensification ladder — a penned, domesticated herd.
  While the pen is still being built under the Corral policy (`corralProgress`, decoded as
  `corral_progress`; `0 < p < 1`) the SAME row reports the meter — "Corral: Building 40%" —
  the animal twin of the tile card's "Cultivation N%". See the Cultivate/Corral investment-rung
  bullet under **Labor allocation UI**.
- **The pen is a managed POPULATION** (`docs/plan_corral_managed_population.md`; snapshot
  `HerdTelemetryState.penUpkeep` / `penFedFraction` → `pen_upkeep` / `pen_fed_fraction`): a penned
  herd cannot graze, so its keeper hauls it food every turn, and **an underfed herd shrinks**. Two
  rows carry that, both in `_herd_summary_lines`:
  - the **Corral** row flips from the "🐄 Corralled" badge to a DANGER-tinted **"⚠ Starving — 40%
    fed"** whenever `PenStatus.is_starving(pen_fed_fraction)` (`_corral_label` / `_corral_value_hex`,
    one tint path, no parallel styling);
  - a **Pen feed** row (only on a penned herd) states the demand — `−1.74 /turn`, WARN amber as a
    standing debit — and, when the keeper came up short, what was actually paid: `−1.74 /turn — only
    40% paid`, DANGER (`_pen_feed_label` / `_pen_feed_value_hex`).
  `pen_upkeep` is this HERD's demand; the band's ledger row is the sim-summed `pen_feed_upkeep`
  across all its pens — the two are never added together, and the client sums neither.
  ui_preview: `herd_domesticated` (fed) / `herd_corral_starving` (40% fed).
  **The map flags it too** (`MapView._draw_herd` → `_draw_distress_badge`): a starving pen's marker
  gets a DANGER **ring** (under the glyph) plus a filled DANGER **badge with a hand-drawn "!"** (over
  it). Both are **drawn geometry, never a tint or a font glyph** — a herd marker is a full-color
  **emoji**, so `modulate` merely yields a slightly-darker brown animal (tried, rendered, reverted),
  and a font ⚠ carries emoji presentation and blobs at marker size (the hazard that forced
  `MagnifierButton` + the line-art policy icons to hand-draw). map_preview: `map_herd_starving` — a
  starving pen beside a **fed** one, which is the A/B the tint failed and the badge passes.
  **And the turn orb** surfaces it as the `starving_pen` attention producer — see the orb bullet.
- **The pen is fenced LAND — the pen-economy surface** (Grazing 2d-γ, `docs/plan_grazing_2d.md` §7;
  snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.penRadius` / `penFootprintTiles` / `penPastureFraction` /
  `penExtendProgress` → `pen_radius` / `pen_footprint_tiles` / `pen_pasture_fraction` /
  `pen_extend_progress`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs herds_to_array`). A penned herd grazes its own
  fenced footprint and the grass it eats **offsets** the larder bill (`pen_upkeep` is now that offset).
  Three surfaces:
  - **Herd drawer** (`_herd_summary_lines`, corralled branch): a **`Pen: radius R · N tiles`** footprint
    row — `pen_footprint_tiles` is the SERVER's in-bounds count, shown **verbatim** (the closed-form
    hex-disk count is wrong at map edges) — and a **`Fed by pasture NN% · larder N.N food/turn`** feed
    split (`pen_pasture_fraction` × 100 + `pen_upkeep`): a self-feeding pen on lush land reads "100% ·
    larder 0.0" (and the amber Pen-feed debit row disappears), a scrub pen "0% · larder 1.7". The Corral
    / Pen-feed / starving rows above are unchanged.
  - **Extend affordance** (`_build_extend_pen_control`, in the herd `%HerdAssignControls`): on a built
    pen with no ring in flight (`pen_extend_progress == 0`) an **"Extend pen"** button emits
    `extend_pen_requested{faction,x,y}` → `Main._on_hud_extend_pen` → `extend_pen <faction> <x> <y>` at
    the pen anchor (a penned herd sits AT `corralled_at`, so its own tile). While a ring is being fenced
    (`pen_extend_progress > 0`) the button is replaced by a WARN-amber **"Fencing N%"** badge — the pen
    twin of the corral-build "Building N%" meter. The server rejects an extend at max radius / unowned /
    Herding-unknown with a feed message; the client does not pre-gate (max radius is not on the wire).
  - **Map footprint highlight** (`MapView._draw_pen_footprint_highlight`, drawn under the herd markers
    when a corralled herd is selected): the fenced hex disk of radius `pen_radius` around the pen anchor,
    in a distinct **enclosure-green** tint (`PEN_FOOTPRINT_FILL`/`_OUTLINE`) — deliberately NOT the gold
    of the roam-range ring, so a fenced footprint reads as a different thing. Reuses the range ring's
    wrapped-column / `_hex_distance` / `_fill_hex` / `_outline_hex` primitives (bounds-clamped by the
    loop). A corralled herd draws no roam-range, so exactly one of the two ever renders.
  ui_preview: `herd_pen_self_feeding` (radius 2 · 19 tiles, 100% · larder 0.0, Extend-pen button) /
  `herd_pen_extending` (mid-extension → "Fencing 60%" badge) / `herd_domesticated` (radius 1 · 7 tiles,
  0% · larder 1.7); map_preview: `map_pasture_pen_footprint` (the green footprint disc, the A/B against
  `map_pasture_herd_range`'s gold roam-range).
- **Forage-patch cultivation readout** (`Hud.gd` `_tile_terrain_lines`): a forage tile's
  intensification state, mirroring the herd Husbandry row. `native/src/lib.rs
  forage_patches_to_array` decodes `foragePatches[]` (`ForagePatchState`) into both the
  snapshot and delta dicts under `forage_patches`; `MapView.display_snapshot` ingests it into
  the tile-keyed `forage_patch_lookup`, and `_tile_info_at` cross-refs it onto `tile_info`
  (`cultivation_progress` / `is_cultivated` / `patch_ecology_phase` / `patch_has_owner` /
  `patch_owner` / `patch_biomass` / `patch_carrying_capacity`, all in `FOW_DISCOVERED_HIDDEN_KEYS`
  so a remembered tile redacts them). The
  card shows a **Cultivation** row: "N%" while the patch is being tended, "🌾 Tended Patch"
  (SIGNAL tint via `_cultivation_value_hex`) once `is_cultivated` — and, beside it, its own
  **Field** row for plant rung 3: "Sowing N%" → "▦ Field" (`patch_field_progress` / `patch_is_field`,
  `_field_label` / `_field_value_hex`). The two are **independent meters on one source** and never
  merge: `Sow` needs no prior patch (seed travels), so a Field may stand on ground that was never
  tended. See `core_sim` intensification ladder — cultivation, and the two-meter split above.
  It also shows an **Ecology** row (`patch_ecology_phase`) for **every** tile carrying a patch —
  cultivated or not, directly under **Forage biomass**. The phase gates whether cultivation can
  accrue at all, so it is the tile's headline condition; it is deliberately **not** gated on
  `is_cultivated` (it was, which hid it on exactly the ordinary forage tiles that needed it).
  Named and rendered **identically to the herd's Ecology row** — same `_ecology_phase_label`
  (neutral `Thriving`, warned `⚠ Stressed` / `⚠ Collapsing`) and the same `_ecology_value_hex`
  amber/red tint applied by `_format_detail_bbcode`, which now keys one shared `"Ecology"` case
  for both surfaces. The module's internal `seasonal_weight` is **not** printed on the `Forage:`
  row (it is a yield coefficient, meaningless to the player); it still drives the sim's yield.
  ui_preview: `food_tile` (Thriving) / `food_tile_stressed` (⚠ Stressed) / `tended_tile`.
  It also shows a **Forage biomass** row — `Forage biomass: 84 / 120` (`biomass` /
  `carryingCapacity`, decoded in `forage_patches_to_array`) — the patch counterpart to a herd's
  **Biomass** row, so a foraged patch reads like wild game does ("how much there is"). Foraging draws
  the biomass down and it regrows logistically toward the capacity (sim default 120). Rendered only
  when `patch_carrying_capacity > 0`, so a plain food-module tile with no patch stays bare.
- **Tile-card Pasture rows — the ANIMAL-edible twin of Forage biomass** (`Hud._tile_terrain_lines`;
  Grazing Phase 2a, `docs/plan_grazing_foundation.md`). `TileState.grazeBiomass` / `grazeCapacity` /
  `grazeEcologyPhase` are decoded in `native/src/lib.rs tile_to_dict` (plain floats, not fixed-point;
  the ubyte phase code is resolved THERE into the same phase *strings* the herd/patch payloads carry,
  so the client keeps ONE ecology vocabulary), cached in `MapView.tile_graze` — **only for tiles that
  actually carry pasture**, mirroring the sim's `GrazeRegistry`, so "no pasture" is an *absent*
  reading — and cross-referenced onto `tile_info` by `_tile_info_at`. Two rows:
  `Pasture: 236 / 240` and `Pasture ecology: ⚠ Stressed`. The pair with `Forage biomass` **is** the
  point: what HUMANS can eat here (seeds/nuts/tubers, food-module tiles only) vs what ANIMALS can eat
  here (grass/browse, nearly every land tile) — *your best farm is usually not your best pasture*.
  - **Rendered only when `graze_capacity > 0`** — on a glacier the card prints **nothing**, never
    `0 / 0` (which would read as a starved pasture rather than an absent one). ui_preview
    `tile_pasture_none`.
  - **The ecology row reuses the shared path** — `_ecology_phase_label` + `_ecology_value_hex`, the
    same neutral/amber/red tint a stressed herd or a stressed forage patch gets. It carries its own
    row KEY (`PASTURE_ECOLOGY_KEY`) purely so a forage tile does not print two rows both named
    "Ecology"; `_format_detail_bbcode` keys both to the one helper — the styling path is not forked.
  - **Pasture is REMEMBERED knowledge, not live state** — it is emitted BEFORE the Discovered
    early-return and is deliberately **not** in `FOW_DISCOVERED_HIDDEN_KEYS`. Grass is a property of
    the GROUND (you can read a steppe from a ridge) and the biome above it is already remembered; what
    a remembered tile redacts is live *contents* (the bands and herds standing on it).
  - ui_preview: `food_tile` (the healthy pair — `Forage biomass 84 / 120` beside
    `Pasture 240 / 240 · Thriving`) / `tile_pasture_stressed` / `tile_pasture_none`.
- **Sedentarization meter** (`Hud.gd` `update_sedentarization`, dispatched from `Main.gd`):
  the player faction's `SedentarizationState.score` (snapshot `sedentarization[]`) shows as a
  compact top-bar block-glyph meter (`▰▰▰▰▰▱▱ 62/100 · soft`, `SedentarizationLabel` in
  `TurnBlock`), tinted amber (soft) / cyan (hard) by stage and hidden until the score is
  meaningful. The soft/hard threshold prompts themselves arrive in the command feed
  (`CommandEventKind::SedentarizationPrompt`). See `core_sim` Campaign Loop — Sedentarization.
- **The Intensification Ladder — THE TWO-METER SPLIT** (`docs/plan_intensification_ladder.md` §4.1;
  the arc's root fix). Two meters advance from one action and they are **different kinds of thing**;
  the client's whole job here is to never let them read as two numbers in a list:
  - **FACTION KNOWLEDGE — the top-bar strip, and the ONLY place a knowledge meter appears.**
    `Hud.update_intensification` (dispatched from `Main.gd`) renders all **four** tracks of
    `IntensificationKnowledgeState` (`intensification_knowledge[]`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs
    intensification_knowledge_to_array`) — `cultivation` / `seed_selection` / `herding` / `penning`,
    in `KNOWLEDGE_TRACK_LABELS` order (each web's ladder, bottom rung first, so the strip reads as
    two ladders climbing). Prefixed **`⚒ Your people know:`** (`KNOWLEDGE_STRIP_PREFIX`) — that
    prefix is load-bearing: it is what stops the strip reading as a stat of whatever is selected.
    A track is hidden until the faction begins it (the row is sparse), reads a bare `✔`
    (`KNOWLEDGE_KNOWN_BADGE` — the prefix already supplies "know") once complete, else a
    **5-cell** bar + the live percent. **The narrow bar + the bare ✔ are not cosmetic**: at the
    shared 10-cell `_meter_bar` width plus the word "learning", four tracks overflowed the top bar
    and clipped the last one off-screen (caught in `two_meter_split.png`). `_meter_bar(score, cells)`
    takes the width as a defaulted param, so Sedentarization is untouched. **AND the strip WRAPS** —
    even narrowed, four tracks on one line ran off the right edge (the "Penning clipped" playtest
    report), so `update_intensification` groups the tracks into rows of `KNOWLEDGE_STRIP_TRACKS_PER_LINE`
    (2) joined by explicit `\n` (the prefix rides the first row). The label lives in the content-sized
    right-docked `TurnBlock`, so Godot autowrap can't engage without a bounded width — the explicit rows
    are what guarantee no track is ever lost off the edge, at any window width or ladder length.
  - **PER-SOURCE PROGRESS — the source's own drawer row, never the strip.** A herd's `Husbandry`
    (`domestication`) + `Corral` (`corral_progress`); a patch's `Cultivation` (`cultivation_progress`)
    + `Field` (`patch_field_progress`). Local to ONE source, decays if abandoned.
  - **THE BRIDGE — a gated verb's reason line** (`_hunt_policy_gates` / `_forage_policy_gates`,
    rendered under the policy picker by `_build_policy_picker`). This is the one place the two meet,
    and the one line that teaches the ladder: a KNOWLEDGE reason names the track, its live percent
    and the **practice** that fills it (`Your people know Penning 45% — ♻ Sustain-hunt a tamed herd
    to learn it`); a SOURCE reason names the meter and the **verb** that fills it (`This herd is 40%
    tamed — ◎ Tame it to finish`). Judge on `two_meter_split.png`.
  - **The `KNOWLEDGE_UNLOCK_NOTES` one-shot feed nudge** fires per track on a real `<1 → >=1`
    transition (player faction only). Note `herding`'s note now names **Tame**, not Corral — see the
    gate reshuffle below.
  See `core_sim` intensification ladder — knowledge.
- **Demographics readout** (`Hud.gd` `update_demographics`, dispatched from `Main.gd`): the player
  faction's age structure from `PopulationDemographicsState` (snapshot `demographics[]`) shows as a
  top-bar line (`Pop 100  👶34 🛠51 🧓15  dep 96/100`, `DemographicsLabel` in `TurnBlock`) — total
  head-count, the three brackets, and the **dependency ratio** `(children+elders)/working` per 100
  workers, tinted amber when dependents outnumber workers / cyan on a healthy labor surplus. Hidden
  until the faction has population. See `core_sim` Campaign Loop — Population & Demographics.
- **Wondrous Sites (discovered)** (snapshot `discovered_sites[]`, per-faction like
  `sedentarization`/`demographics`; each entry `{faction, sites:[{x,y,site_id,category,display_name,
  glyph}]}` with `category`/`display_name`/`glyph` resolved server-side — client renders the provided
  glyph/name, no client-side site config; undiscovered sites are never sent). Decoded in
  `native/src/lib.rs discovered_sites_to_array` into both the full-snapshot and delta dicts under
  `discovered_sites`. Surfaced three ways, all filtered to `PLAYER_FACTION_ID`:
  (1) **Top-bar readout** (`Hud.gd update_discoveries`, dispatched from `Main.gd`): a compact
  `◈ Discoveries N  <distinct glyphs>` line (`DiscoveriesLabel` in `TurnBlock`, cyan), hidden when 0.
  (2) **Map glyph markers** (`MapView.gd`): ingested into `discovered_sites` + a `discovered_site_lookup`
  (`Vector2i → site`) mirroring `food_modules`; `_draw_discovered_site` draws the site's `glyph` (drop-shadow,
  no backing disc) in a fixed **edge slot** via the shared secondary-marker system (see Map markers below),
  gated on `_visibility_state_at != "unexplored"` (persists on any known/remembered tile — Discovered OR
  Active — since a site is permanent geographic knowledge, unlike the Active-only food-site/herd markers).
  (3) **Tile card** (`Hud._tile_terrain_lines`): a `Site: <display_name>` row (from `_tile_info_at`'s
  `discovered_site_lookup` cross-ref → `site_name`), shown before the FoW discovered early-return since
  it's known knowledge. The server also pushes a `SiteDiscovered` command-feed entry, which renders
  generically via the server-provided `kind`/`label` (no client kind→label map needed). See
  `core_sim` — Wondrous Sites.
- **Band food status** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.daysOfFood` / `activity` / `supplyNetworkId` /
  `stores[]`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs` `population_to_dict` as `days_of_food` / `activity` /
  `supply_network_id` / `stores{item:qty}`): the green/amber/red warn·critical thresholds and the
  day→color mapping live in one place, `ui/BandFoodStatus.gd` (config `src/config/band_status_config.json`,
  key `food_days.{warn,critical}`; `999` = not food-limited → ∞). Surfaced three ways:
  (1) `MapView._draw_band_status` draws a food-days dot on each **player** band
  (`_is_player_unit`); (2) `Hud._band_food_line` adds a `Food  <N>  (<D> days)`
  row to the band selection panel, tinted by the thresholds via `_format_detail_bbcode`
  — **player bands only** (`_is_player_unit`, the same gate Morale uses, and for the same
  reason: **a rival's larder is not ours to see**). A foreign cohort carries no
  `days_of_food`/`stores` on the wire, so rendering the row for one **fabricated knowledge**
  — a healthy-green `Food 0 (∞)`, the UI claiming we'd counted a larder we cannot observe.
  A foreign band's drawer now shows only what is honestly observable from outside: its
  **Position**, plus the name/size on its roster row. The reset of the disclosure context
  (`_food_flow_present` / `_selected_band_food_days` / `_disclosure_state`) lives at the top
  of `_unit_summary_lines`, NOT inside `_band_food_line` — the skipped call must not leave the
  previous render's caret or food-days tint behind;
  (3) `MapView._draw_supply_links` faint-chains player bands sharing a `supply_network_id` (`0` = solo).
  **Band food flow on the Food line** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.foodIncome`/`foodConsumption`/
  **`penFeedUpkeep`**, decoded as `food_income`/`food_consumption`/`pen_feed_upkeep`, flowed onto the
  MapView unit marker + guarded by `marker_field_guard`): for a **player** band with real flow,
  `_band_food_line` appends the **net per-turn rate** — `Food 15 (19 days) · −0.77 /turn` — where
  **net = `food_income − food_consumption − pen_feed_upkeep`** (`_band_net_food`), tinted green (≥0) /
  red (<0). **The ledger has THREE terms, not two:** a band keeping a corral pays its penned herd's
  feed straight off the larder every turn (a confined herd cannot graze), and that debit is in
  *neither* of the other two. Omitting it made the row **lie** — a Red Deer pen overstated the surplus
  by ~1.74/turn against a band that eats ~1.2, and the larder then drained with no explanation.
  `penFeedUpkeep` is the food the sim **actually paid** this turn summed across every pen the band
  keeps; the client **must not** re-derive it by summing the herds' `penUpkeep` (the sim owns every
  yield number — see `core_sim/CLAUDE.md` → Pre-commit Yield Forecast; the identity
  `larder_delta == income − consumption − pen_feed` is pinned by `integration_tests/tests/pen_food_ledger.rs`).
  The days-to-empty stays only in the `(N days)` figure; it is not
  repeated. The `Food` label is a **click-to-expand disclosure** (a `▸/▾` caret) toggling a
  **category breakdown** beneath it — indented `▲ +X  Gathered` / `▲ +Y  Hunted` / `▼ −Z  Eaten
  (people)` / `▼ −W  🐄 Pen feed (animals)` sub-lines (Gathered/Hunted = Σ per-source `actual_yield`
  by kind, Eaten = `food_consumption`, Pen feed = `pen_feed_upkeep`, shown only when a pen is kept —
  **people and animals eat from the same larder but are DIFFERENT decisions**, so they are different
  rows), rendered through the **shared morale-breakdown path** in `_format_detail_bbcode` (income ▲
  green, debits ▼ amber). ui_preview: `band_pen_feed` (fed pen: net +2.99 = 5.88 − 1.15 − 1.74) /
  `band_pen_starving` (part-paid feed, net −0.53 red). The breakdown **auto-shows when food is concerning** (`_food_is_concerning`:
  net-negative OR runway below the warn threshold, mirroring `_morale_is_concerning`), else it's
  collapsed but reachable via the click. No flow → the bare `Food N (D days)` line,
  no net/disclosure. **The Food + Morale rows share ONE disclosure mechanism** (see "Band morale
  readout" for the shared helpers) — see `_register_disclosure` / `_on_detail_meta_clicked` /
  `_breakdown_open_for` / `_breakdown_expanded`. (The label + click are wired on BOTH the Occupants-card
  drawer's `%OccupantDetail` and the dockable Band/City panel's `get_band_detail_label()`.)
- **Band morale readout** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.morale`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
  `population_to_dict` as `morale`, a 0–1 float on each cohort dict; flowed into the MapView unit marker
  in `_rebuild_unit_markers`): a band can shrink while well-fed when a harsh tile erodes morale until
  births fall below elder mortality. `BandFoodStatus.gd` owns the morale thresholds too (config key
  `morale.{warn,critical}` = `0.40`/`0.25`, just above the ~0.20 birth floor) and the mirrored
  `color_for_morale`/`hex_for_morale` helpers (same green/amber/red palette, but a plain scalar — no
  "unlimited" sentinel). `Hud._band_morale_line` adds a `Morale: <N>%` row to the drawer **for player
  bands only** (`_is_player_unit`), tinted by `hex_for_morale` via `_format_detail_bbcode` (same
  stash-then-tint pattern as the Food row, using `_selected_band_morale`).
- **Morale trend + named cause** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.moraleDelta` / `moraleCause`, decoded in
  `native/src/lib.rs` `population_to_dict` as `morale_delta` (raw Scalar/1e6, signed) / `morale_cause`
  (int; `0=None,1=Terrain,2=Cold,3=Unrest`), flowed into the MapView unit marker): "low morale" named the
  symptom, not the cause — the morale drivers live server-side and were discarded each turn until the
  cohort started exporting the per-turn trend + dominant negative driver. `Hud._band_morale_line` appends
  a trend arrow (`▼` falling / `▲` rising / none when `|morale_delta| < MORALE_TREND_EPSILON`) and, when
  falling, the plain-language cause via `_morale_cause_label` — `Terrain`→"harsh terrain", `Cold`→"harsh
  climate" (the server penalty fires on hot **or** cold deviation, so not literally "cold"),
  `Unrest`→"unrest". `Terrain` appends the band's `_selected_tile_info.terrain_label` in parens
  (`Morale: 22% ▼ — harsh terrain (Karst Cavern Mouth)`) — the "it's the hex you're on" payload. A
  rehydrated save reports `morale_delta 0 / cause None` for one turn (the sim doesn't persist them); the
  row degrades to a bare percentage.
- **Civilization Wellbeing — productivity, itemized morale, recovery** (see
  `docs/plan_civ_wellbeing.md`; snapshot `PopulationCohortState.outputMultiplier` /
  `discontentFraction` / `lastEmigrated` / `lastImmigrated` / `grievance` + the four signed
  Layer-1 contributions `moraleSettling` / `moraleTerrain` / `moraleClimate` / `moraleUnrest`,
  decoded in `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` as `output_multiplier` / `discontent_fraction`
  / `last_emigrated` / `last_immigrated` / `grievance` (telemetry only, not displayed in P1) /
  `morale_settling` / `morale_terrain` / `morale_climate` / `morale_unrest`, all flowed onto the
  MapView unit marker in `_rebuild_unit_markers`). Player-band drawer only (`_unit_summary_lines`):
  - **Output row** (`_band_output_line`): `Output: N%` shown when `output_multiplier < OUTPUT_FULL`
    (1.0), placed just under Morale. Tinted ink → amber → red by `BandFoodStatus.hex_for_output`
    (config `band_status_config.json` `output.{warn,critical}` = `0.85`/`0.60`; near-full reads
    neutral ink, *not* green — it's a productivity note, not a "good"). Ties productivity to morale.
  - **Itemized morale breakdown** (`_morale_breakdown_lines`): the four signed contributions
    (their sum IS `morale_delta`) as indented sub-lines (e.g. `    ▲ +1.0%  settling`). Only
    contributions above `BandFoodStatus.morale_breakdown_epsilon()` (config `morale.breakdown_epsilon`
    = `0.002`) list. Labels: `settling`, `harsh terrain (<terrain_label>)` (matches the headline cause
    treatment), `harsh climate`, and `unrest`/`culture` by sign. `_format_detail_bbcode` tints each
    row two-tone by its sign glyph (▲ = HEALTHY green, ▼ = WARN amber — deliberately not a rainbow);
    the indented breakdown lines are intercepted before the KV split. The **Morale row is a
    click-to-expand disclosure identical to Food** (the `▸/▾` caret + `meta_clicked` toggle share
    `_register_disclosure` / `_on_detail_meta_clicked` / `_breakdown_open_for` / `_breakdown_expanded`,
    keyed `"morale:<entity>"`): **auto-shown when concerning** (`_morale_is_concerning`: below warn
    **or** falling past `MORALE_TREND_EPSILON`), else collapsed but expandable via the click. The
    contributions always compute so the good state can be manually expanded; the disclosure is offered
    only when there's actually something to show (a contribution above epsilon, or the concerning
    recovery line).
  - **Recovery guidance** (`RECOVERY_GUIDANCE_TEXT`): a dim `↑ Recover: move to Hospitable ground ·
    Scout · Hunt` line (the real levers, NOT harvest), appended under the breakdown **only when
    morale is concerning** (a healthy band that manually expands its breakdown is not told to
    "recover"). `_split_detail_kv` skips lines beginning with `↑` so it renders as a dim sentence.
  - **Action morale hints**: the Scout button tooltip (`MORALE_HINT_SCOUT`, "(+morale)") and the four
    persistent Hunt/Follow policy tooltips (Sustain/Surplus/Market/Eradicate get `MORALE_HINT_PERSISTENT`
    appended, "(+morale/turn)") advertise the positive levers; the one-shot Single policy does not.
- **Tile-card Habitability** (snapshot `TileState.habitability`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
  `tile_to_dict` as `habitability` (raw Scalar/1e6; band-independent per-turn morale drain of the tile's
  terrain + temperature, ≥0, bigger = harsher), stored in `MapView.tile_habitability` keyed by
  `Vector2i` and copied onto the `_tile_info_at` dict): `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` adds a
  `Habitability: <rating>` row (before the FoW discovered/unexplored returns — it's terrain-intrinsic, so
  fine on a remembered tile; only shown when the field is present). `ui/TileHabitability.gd` is the single
  source of truth — config `src/config/tile_habitability_config.json` (`habitability.{hospitable_max,
  fair_max,harsh_max}` = `0.02`/`0.05`/`0.09`) buckets the drain into Hospitable/Fair/Harsh/Hostile,
  tinted HEALTHY/INK/WARN/DANGER via `hex_for_rating` in `_format_detail_bbcode` (mirrors the
  `BandFoodStatus` bucketing pattern). The Karst Cavern Mouth (~0.0825) reads "Harsh" (amber).
  With the latitude climate + cold-morale tolerance dead-band (see `core_sim`), temperate
  mid-latitudes read "Hospitable", the equator "Hospitable/Fair", and poles/high-alt/caverns
  "Harsh/Hostile" — the config buckets (`0.02`/`0.05`/`0.09`) spread cleanly across that range,
  so no re-tune was needed.
- **Tile-card Climate** (snapshot `TileState.temperature`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
  `tile_to_dict` as `temperature` (°); temperature is now a **latitude + elevation** climate
  (equator-in-the-middle, poles cold) with a small element jitter, NOT the old element
  checkerboard — see `core_sim`), stored in `MapView.tile_temperature` keyed by `Vector2i` and
  copied onto the `_tile_info_at` dict): `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` adds a `Climate: <band>` row
  next to Habitability (before the FoW discovered/unexplored returns — it's terrain-intrinsic, so
  fine on a remembered tile; only shown when the field is present so rehydrated tiles degrade
  gracefully). `ui/TileClimate.gd` is the single source of truth — config
  `src/config/tile_climate_config.json` (`climate.{tropical_min,warm_min,temperate_min,cool_min}`
  = `26`/`20`/`12`/`3`) maps the temperature into Tropical/Warm/Temperate/Cool/Polar, making the
  latitude gradient legible ("far south → Polar"). The row is **informational** — neutral ink, no
  HEALTHY/WARN/DANGER tint, so it doesn't overload the Habitability row's warning semantics.
- **Band alerts → the turn orb** (`Hud.gd` `update_band_alerts`, dispatched from `Main.gd` on the
  snapshot `populations`): the standalone left-dock **Alerts panel was removed** and its alerts folded
  into the turn-orb attention model (see next bullet) — the single player-faction loop now builds the
  orb's `attention` array instead of a separate alerts array. NOTE: cohorts carry no top-level band label
  in the snapshot — names fall back to a positional "Band N"; a server-side band-label field would make
  names authoritative.
- **Turn orb & attention model** (`ui/TurnOrb.gd` + `ui/TurnOrb.tscn`, last `BottomBar` child;
  `docs/plan_hud_nav_turn_orb.md`): the bottom-right orb replaces the "Advance Turn" button and
  is a **generic attention hub**. Readiness = the attention registry is **empty** → a calm cyan
  `SIGNAL` pulse ("nothing needs you"); any entries → the pulse stops and a **count badge** tinted
  by the highest severity shows. **The orb face always advances the turn** (`_on_face_pressed`): with
  an **empty** registry the click emits `advance_requested` directly (no popover — an empty popover has
  nothing to review, and once mis-stretched to full height it pushed its own `Advance ▸` footer
  off-screen, trapping the player); with **entries** it toggles a **reasons popover** (built at
  runtime, `HudStyle.card_stylebox()`) — one row per entry (severity stripe + kind icon + label +
  detail + right-aligned `Jump →`), highest-severity first, plus an `Advance ▸` footer. The orb
  knows nothing about producers; it renders a list of generic **Attention** dicts:
  `{kind, severity ("info"|"warn"|"critical" → SIGNAL/WARN/DANGER), label, detail, x, y}` where
  `x < 0` = non-locating (renders `Open ▸`, a no-op stub for now). Kind→icon (in `TurnOrb.gd`):
  `starving`→🍖, `losing_population`→📉, `idle_workers`→🛠, `awaiting_orders`→▮▮ (read from
  `FoodIcons.STATUS_ICONS` — the same glyph the Band panel's awaiting row wears), unknown→●.
  Row labels **clip** and `POPOVER_WIDTH` is sized to the widest producer row: a row's inner HBox is
  anchored to its Button (not a container child), so an over-wide label used to spill its `Jump →`
  outside the card instead of widening it. Wiring stays stable via Hud
  relays: a row's jump → `focus_requested` → `alert_focus_requested` → `MapView.focus_on_tile`
  (the same centering the retired Alerts panel used); the footer → `advance_requested` →
  `next_turn_requested(1)`; `update_overlay` pushes the turn number via `set_turn`. The **four live
  producers** (all in `Hud.update_band_alerts`, each pushed with the tile `current_x`/`current_y` so
  Jump locates it) — the folded-in Alerts panel, plus the expedition one. The first three run in one
  loop over the player faction's BANDS:
  - **`starving`** (critical) — `BandFoodStatus.is_critical(days)`; label `"<band> starving"`, detail = `_food_days_text(days)`.
  - **`losing_population`** (warn) — shrank vs the previous snapshot (`_prev_band_sizes`); label `"<band> losing population"`, detail = `_decline_reason(days, morale, morale_cause, last_emigrated)` (`— starving` / `— people leaving` / `— harsh terrain|climate|unrest` / `— low morale`).
  - **`idle_workers`** (warn) — `idle_workers > 0`; label `"N idle workers"`, detail = band name. Supersedes the old `activity == idle` alert (a worker count is more actionable).

  - **`starving_pen`** (warn, `_starving_pen_attention`) — a pen this band keeps whose feed it could
    not pay: the herd is **shrinking every turn** and a 25-turn investment is draining away (it
    recovers if fed, so the player must hear about it *while it is reversible*). Label `"<Species> pen
    starving"`, detail `"40% fed — the herd is shrinking"`, icon = the corral 🐄 (`FoodIcons.POLICY_ICONS`).
    **Found via the band's own Corral labor assignments, never a scan of `herds`** — a herd carries no
    owner field client-side, so scanning would alarm on a RIVAL's pen. Its **Jump routes to the HERD**
    (`_starving_pen_at` → `_focus_labor_source`, the Band panel's Hunt-row path), so the drawer that
    explains the alert actually opens. **On the double-report question:** a pen only goes unfed when
    the keeper's larder came up short, so the same empty larder usually also trips `starving`
    (critical) on that band. They are **not one alert twice** — one cause, two different losses (the
    people are dying / the herd is dying), two subjects, two jumps, two remedies — but only **one gets
    to shout**: the band's row stays critical, this one rides below at WARN. ui_preview
    `turn_orb_starving_pen` renders exactly that pair.
  - The detail line is deliberately terse: orb rows **clip at `POPOVER_WIDTH`**, and appending the
    keeper's name ("· Band 1") pushed this row past it (rendered, seen cut, shortened).

  The fourth (`_awaiting_orders_attention`) runs over the **EXPEDITIONS** split out of that loop:
  - **`awaiting_orders`** (warn) — an expedition in `ExpeditionPhase::Awaiting`: parked at its
    objective, burning provisions, doing nothing until the player acts. Structurally the same class
    as idle workers (a demand on the player, an efficiency loss, not a crisis) — hence WARN, and
    hence it belongs on the orb rather than only on a band panel you happen to have open. **One row
    per party, not one aggregate** (each is a separate decision with its own destination; idle
    workers genuinely IS one aggregate): label = the phase words from `EXPEDITION_PHASE_LABELS`
    ("Awaiting orders"), detail = `"<mission> · <objective>"` (mission from
    `EXPEDITION_MISSION_LABELS`; objective = the followed herd for a hunt party, the party's tile for
    a scout). Capped at `ATTENTION_AWAITING_MAX_ROWS` — the popover is positioned ABOVE the orb, so an
    unbounded list would climb off-screen and take the `Advance ▸` footer with it — with the remainder
    folded into one `"+N more awaiting orders"` row that jumps to the first party past the cap (so
    even the aggregate row is actionable, not a dead `Open ▸` stub). **Its Jump reuses the Band
    panel's expedition-row path**: `Hud._on_turn_orb_focus` resolves an awaiting expedition standing
    on the jumped-to tile (`_awaiting_expedition_at`) and routes through
    `_on_panel_expedition_selected` (recenter + pin that exact expedition so its drawer opens),
    falling back to the plain `alert_focus_requested` recenter for the band-located producers.

  The orb severity-sorts (critical floats up), so a starving band tops the popover. Future producers
  (`war` / `decision`) are stubs the model already fits — one producer each, **no orb changes** (the
  awaiting one needed only a kind→icon entry). ui_preview: `turn_orb_attention` (the three band
  producers) / `turn_orb_awaiting_orders` (awaiting rows + idle workers coexisting, incl. the cap's
  overflow row).
- **Targeting: move-band + send-expedition + send-hunt-expedition** (`Hud.gd`): the single-task
  forage/scout/hunt/follow `_pending_*` flows were retired with labor allocation. Three targeting
  flows remain, all built on the same `_pending_*` → `_current_targeting_info()` →
  `_refresh_targeting()` machinery: `_pending_move_band` (`command: "move"`, `need: "tile"`),
  `_pending_send_expedition` (`command: "expedition"`, `need: "tile"`, carries the outfitted band +
  party size), and `_pending_send_hunt_expedition` (`command: "hunt_expedition"`, `need: "herd"`).
  `_current_targeting_info()` returns a descriptor (`{active, command, need, origin_x/y,
  context_label}`) for whichever is set; `_refresh_targeting()` shows the floating **targeting
  banner** (top-centre, `HudStyle.banner_stylebox()`: cyan reticle + command + instruction + Cancel)
  and emits `targeting_changed(info)`. `show_tile_selection` + `notify_hex_selected` dispatch all
  three pending flows on the click (the tile click carries `tile_info.herds`, which the hunt flow
  resolves its target from).
- **Main forwards** `hud.targeting_changed → map_view.set_targeting` and
  `map_view.targeting_cancel_requested → hud.cancel_active_targeting`.
- **MapView draws** the overlay (`_draw_targeting`): `need == "tile"` draws a reticle on the
  hovered hex (the `need == "band"` path is now unused). Esc / right-click during targeting emit
  `targeting_cancel_requested` instead of panning; the pulse is animated from `_process`.
- **Resolution**: the destination tile click (`_try_dispatch_pending_move_band`) emits
  `move_band_requested` → `Main._on_hud_move_band` → `move_band …`; the expedition-target click
  (`_try_dispatch_pending_send_expedition`) emits `send_expedition_requested` →
  `Main._on_hud_send_expedition` → `send_expedition …`.
- **Scouting expedition** (`docs/plan_exploration_and_sites.md` §2; snapshot
  `PopulationCohortState.isExpedition`/`expeditionMission`/`expeditionPhase`, decoded in
  `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` as `is_expedition`/`expedition_mission`/`expedition_phase`,
  flowed onto the MapView unit marker in `_rebuild_unit_markers`; `homeBandEntity` is decoded as
  `home_band_entity` (the outfitting band — powers the Band panel's Active-expeditions section),
  while the persistence-only `expeditionAnnounced`/`pendingReveal*` fields stay undecoded). A
  detached party is a `PopulationCohort` tagged `Expedition` that flows through the same
  `populations[]` array as a band. Surfaced four ways:
  (1) **Distinct map marker** (`MapView._draw_unit` → `_draw_expedition_body`): a hollow,
  faction-tinted **flag disc** (⚑) instead of a resident band's solid dot; when
  `expedition_phase == "awaiting"` a **pulsing amber (WARN) ring** signals idle-at-objective needing
  an order (animated from `_expedition_time` in `_process`, gated on `_has_awaiting_expedition` set
  at marker-rebuild). Resident-band rendering is untouched.
  (2) **Expedition drawer panel** (`Hud._render_occupant_drawer` → `_build_expedition_panel`):
  replaces the labor-allocation panel for a selected expedition (no labor in v1). Drawer text
  (`_expedition_summary_lines`) shows Mission / humanized Phase / Party / Provisions (`daysOfFood`);
  the panel hosts **Recall** (→ `recall_expedition_requested` → `Main._on_hud_recall_expedition` →
  `recall_expedition …`) + **Move** (reuses `_on_move_band_pressed`; `_resolve_assign_band` returns
  the selected expedition since it's a player unit — Move retargets it via `move_band` unchanged, no
  un-gating needed).
  (3) **Outfit UI** (`Hud._build_allocation_panel` → `_build_send_expedition_controls`): on a
  selected resident band, a "Send scouting expedition" party-size stepper (max =
  `min(idle_workers, max_expedition_party_size)`; the server's hard cap comes from the
  `maxExpeditionPartySize` snapshot field, decoded as `max_expedition_party_size`, defensively
  falling back to idle when absent/0) + a button entering `_pending_send_expedition` targeting.
  (4) The `marker_field_guard` covers the four new marker keys (`is_expedition`,
  `expedition_mission`, `expedition_phase`, `max_expedition_party_size`). The server still rejects
  a genuinely over-cap request with a feed message as a backstop.
- **Hunting expedition** (PR 2, `docs/plan_exploration_and_sites.md` §2b; snapshot
  `PopulationCohortState.expeditionTargetHerd` (string fauna_id) / `expeditionHuntPolicy` (string
  `sustain|surplus|market|eradicate`) / `expeditionCarryCap` (float), decoded as
  `expedition_target_herd` / `expedition_hunt_policy` / `expedition_carry_cap` and flowed onto the
  marker; `expedition_mission` also takes `"hunt"`, `expedition_phase` also takes
  `"hunting"`/`"delivering"`). A hunt party follows a migratory herd, accumulates food up to a carry
  cap, and drops it at the band — the second verb on the same expedition machinery. Surfaced:
  (1) **Distinct map marker** (`MapView._draw_expedition_body`): a hollow 🏹 **bow disc** (vs the
  scout's ⚑ flag), keyed on `expedition_mission == "hunt"`. Phase read: `hunting` (gathering) draws a
  small red "working" cue ring; `delivering`/`returning` (hauling home) draw a green food pip.
  (2) **Hunt drawer panel** (`Hud._expedition_summary_lines` branches on mission): Mission "Hunting
  expedition", **Target** herd (`expedition_target_herd`, species via `_herd_label_for_id` → raw id
  fallback), **Policy** (`expedition_hunt_policy`, capitalized), humanized **Phase**
  (Hunting/Delivering/Returning), Party, and **Carried X / cap** (`stores` total vs
  `expedition_carry_cap`, days from `daysOfFood`) with a **· FULL** badge at the ceiling. Reuses
  `_build_expedition_panel` (Recall + Move, "Returning"-when-returning treatment — mission-agnostic,
  so hunt parties get it too).
  (3) **Outfit UI** (`Hud._build_send_expedition_controls`): under the shared "Send expedition"
  section (party stepper + "Send scouting expedition"), a **hunt policy radio**
  (`_build_policy_picker(…, _send_hunt_policy)`, Sustain/Surplus/Market/Eradicate, default Sustain)
  with a one-line behaviour hint (`SEND_HUNT_POLICY_HINTS`), then "Send hunting expedition". It enters
  a HERD-targeting pending mode (`_pending_send_hunt_expedition`, `command: "hunt_expedition"`,
  `need: "herd"`) carrying band + party + policy; the target click resolves to a huntable herd on the
  clicked hex (`_huntable_herd_id_on_tile` reads `tile_info.herds`) and emits
  `send_hunt_expedition_requested` → `Main._on_hud_send_hunt_expedition` →
  `send_hunt_expedition <faction> <band> <party_workers> <fauna_id> [policy]` (trailing policy;
  server defaults Sustain). No huntable herd on the hex → a command-feed nudge, stays in targeting.
  `MapView._draw_targeting` glows huntable herds + reticles the hovered hex for `need == "herd"`.
  (4) `marker_field_guard` covers `expedition_target_herd` / `expedition_hunt_policy` /
  `expedition_carry_cap`. Recall is the unchanged `recall_expedition` (works for hunt parties too).
  (5) **Pre-launch RAID forecast — the payload in animals** (server `5a130e0`): a hunting expedition is
  a **greedy raid** — it grabs the herd's standing surplus above the policy floor in a burst and comes
  home — so the readout headlines the PAYLOAD: **whole animals delivered over the turns it takes**,
  `delivers ≈5 Wild Boar over ≈7 turns · ~20 food`. The player must know **before** committing workers,
  but the herd isn't chosen until the *targeting* step (the outfit block only picks party + policy), so
  the forecast hangs off the **targeting banner**: while `_pending_send_hunt_expedition` is armed,
  `Hud.show_tooltip` (already fed by `MapView.tile_hovered`) records the hovered hex in
  `_hovered_tile_info`, and `_targeting_banner_bbcode` appends a second line from `_hunt_forecast_bbcode`
  — cyan `delivers ≈N <Herd> over ≈M turns · ~F food` for a brisk raid, WARN-amber
  `⚠ … — a slow raid` past `expeditionViabilityWarnTurns` (or `delivers ≈N <Herd> over many turns …
  — a slow raid` for a **long** raid, `turnsToFill == 0`, that ran the whole horizon still delivering),
  amber denial `<Herd> — denial mission … delivers no food` (Eradicate), and DANGER-red
  `⚠ <Herd> is too lean to raid — its surplus is spent` when `animalsTaken == 0` (the herd at/below the
  policy floor). The click still commits (information, not a gate — except the no-surplus case, which the
  herd panel's button DISABLES; see `%HerdAssignControls`).
  **The food total** is `animals × HerdTelemetryState.foodPerAnimal` — a lookup product of two exported
  numbers (NOT the ecology model), set on the returned dict as `food` only when `food_per_animal > 0`
  (older snapshot → animals+turns render alone). All rendered by the shared `_hunt_forecast_line_bbcode`
  at **both** entry points (banner + herd panel), so the two can never quote different numbers.
  **The client does ZERO arithmetic for an expedition's raid — it is a pure TABLE LOOKUP.** A band and
  an expedition are different actors and read **different herd fields**; never one for the other:
  - **Expedition → `HerdTelemetryState.huntTripEstimates`** (one entry per policy × party size),
    decoded in `native/src/lib.rs` into `hunt_trip_estimates` on the herd dict, keyed
    `"<policy>:<party_workers>"` → `{turns_to_fill, delivers_food, animals_taken}` (so it flows through
    `tile_info.herds` untouched — **`animals_taken` is the newest appended field, added to this decoder
    dict in this pass; the decoder has silently dropped appended fields 5× now, always audit it first**).
    `_hunt_trip_forecast` just looks it up: `delivers_food == false` → **denial** (Eradicate — "delivers
    no food", the SIM decides this, the client never infers it from the policy string); `animals_taken
    == 0` → **no surplus** (the one blocked case — the raid returns empty); else the raid delivers, with
    `turns_to_fill == 0` meaning a **long raid** (ran the whole horizon) and `> expeditionViabilityWarnTurns`
    flagged **slow**. `animalsTaken` PLATEAUS with party size once the surplus binds — that plateau is
    the **max-useful** party the stepper caps at (`_expedition_useful_cap`). **Do not re-derive any of
    this** — the sim forward-simulates the raid (the herd's state moves under the party, a horizon bounds
    the answer) and exports the numbers.
  - **Resident band → `huntPolicyCeilings`** (`provisionsPerTurn`, the herd's renewable **flow**),
    decoded as `hunt_policy_ceilings`. This one IS pure client arithmetic, and the schema blesses it:
    `min(workers × huntPerWorkerProvisions, ceiling) × outputMultiplier` (`_hunt_take_rate` →
    `_local_hunt_preview_bbcode`) — but it must still never re-derive the ecology/MSY model.
  Plus the global levers echoed on every cohort (same idiom as `maxExpeditionPartySize`, decoded +
  flowed onto the MapView unit marker + covered by `marker_field_guard`). **Neither of them is an
  input to an expedition's raid** — that is the lookup above. Their real jobs: `expeditionViabilityWarnTurns`
  = the **slow-raid threshold** applied to `turnsToFill`, and
  `huntPerWorkerProvisions` = the **resident-band local-hunt take rate** (the one legitimate piece of
  client arithmetic, pinned by `exported_snapshot_fields_reproduce_band_hunt_take`). The one-liner
  that keeps this straight: **band = flow arithmetic; expedition = lookup.** Missing estimate /
  levers absent → no forecast line, banner unchanged. (The old `haul` key — `party ×
  expeditionPerWorkerCarry` — is retired: a raid's payload is the sim's `animalsTaken`, not a
  party×lever product. `expeditionPerWorkerCarry` is still decoded onto the marker for completeness but
  no longer feeds the forecast.)
  ui_preview banner states `hunt_forecast_viable` / `hunt_forecast_slow` / `hunt_forecast_no_surplus`
  + `expedition_launch_policy_sustain`.
- **Retired verbs (Early-Game Labor slice 3a):** the server now parses-but-ignores
  `follow_herd` / `scout` / `forage` / `hunt_fauna` / `hunt_game`. Every client control that
  emitted them was removed or repointed so nothing is silently dead: the map double-click
  `scout` shortcut was dropped and `follow` repointed to quick-assign hunters; Main's
  `_issue_*`/`_on_hud_follow_herd`/`_on_hud_unit_scout` builders are gone; the Fauna tab's
  follow button, the Terrain tab's Scout Tile button, and the Commands tab's scenario
  Scout/Follow rows were removed (script + `InspectorLayer.tscn` nodes). No code path in
  `Main.gd`/`Hud.gd`/`MapView.gd`/`Inspector.gd` builds any of those five lines.

## Band/City dockable panel

`ui/BandCityPanel.gd`/`.tscn` — a CanvasLayer that is the **persistent band/city
command center**: shown whenever ≥1 player band exists, always displaying a
"current band" (`_panel_band`). Design/roadmap: `docs/plan_band_city_dock.md`.

- **Dockable + persisted.** The user docks it to any of the 4 edges (default
  `SIDE_LEFT`) or collapses it to a thin rail; the choice (+ collapsed bool)
  persists to `user://band_city_dock.cfg` via `ConfigFile` (loaded in `_ready`,
  saved on change — the client's first user-pref file). It reserves its edge
  through the registry above: `reservation_changed(edge, size)` →
  `Main._apply_reservation(&"band_panel", edge, size)` (size = the cross-axis
  width/height, `COLLAPSED_SIZE` when railed, or 0 when hidden), so the map + HUD
  reflow off the reserved edge. All geometry/typography are named constants +
  `HudStyle`; the map-facing edge gets a `SIGNAL_DEEP` accent seam.
- **Header chrome.** Settlement **stage glyph + name + stage label**
  (`set_header` — glyph/label from the band marker's `settlement_stage_icon` /
  `settlement_stage_label`, neutral glyph fallback), a `◀ n/N ▶` **cycler**
  (`set_cycler`) over `_player_bands`, a 2×2 **dock chooser** (active edge
  highlighted), and a **collapse** toggle. `cycle_requested(delta)` → Main relays
  to `Hud.cycle_panel_band`.
- **Header rows — no restated identity.** The panel's own chrome already states the band's **name +
  settlement stage**, so its summary grid does NOT repeat them: `_unit_summary_lines(unit, in_panel =
  true)` **drops the `Unit: <name>` row** (it was a third copy of the name) and **replaces `Size: <n>`**
  — population under another name — with a **`Population  29 · Workers 14 (Idle 12)`** row
  (`WORKERS_VALUE_FORMAT`, idle from the SAME `_effective_idle` the `+` steppers gate on). That labor
  line used to render as the allocation stack's first block, which meant it appeared wherever CURRENT
  ACTIONS did — **stranded between Active expeditions and Current actions**; the panel now passes
  `with_population_header = false` to `_build_allocation_sections`, so it exists once, in the identity
  grid. The header reads: name / stage / Population / Food / Morale / Position.
  `Unit` and `Size` are gone from **both** hosts — the Occupants drawer's roster row names the band
  and shows its size, so they restated it there too. `in_panel` survives as the gate on the
  **Population** row alone: the dock is the only host with a labor readout, and a foreign band has no
  `working_age`/`idle_workers`, so rendering it in the drawer would print a fabricated
  `Workers 0 (Idle 0)`. `_unit_summary_lines` is still shared with the Occupants-card drawer (foreign
  bands + the no-panel `ui_preview` fallback), and the legacy in-card allocation host keeps the
  population header block.
- **Content relocation (from the Occupants card).** The **player-band** branch of
  `Hud._render_occupant_drawer` now renders into the panel via `_render_band_into_panel`,
  which assembles an ordered array of **section blocks** — a summary block
  (`_unit_summary_lines`), the Active-expeditions block, then the allocation sections
  (`_build_allocation_sections`) — and hands them to `BandCityPanel.set_band_sections`
  (see "Responsive body"). `_build_allocation_sections` returns the discrete Workers /
  Current actions / Band roles / Orders / Send-expedition VBoxes; the legacy
  `_build_allocation_panel(band, target)` wrapper still exists and fills the flat
  `%AllocationPanel` (the no-panel `ui_preview` fallback) by appending those same blocks.
  Herd/expedition detail stays in the Occupants card (`%OccupantDetail` / `%AllocationPanel`
  — still the expedition host **and** the no-panel fallback).
- **Live + persistent.** `_refresh_panel_band()` (called each snapshot from
  `update_band_alerts`) hides the panel when there are zero player bands, else
  re-resolves `_panel_band` against the fresh snapshot (by entity, falling back to
  the first band) and re-renders so steppers/idle stay current. Selecting a
  herd/empty tile leaves `_panel_band` intact — the panel persists across selection
  changes. `cycle_panel_band(delta)` walks `_player_bands`, **recenters the map**
  on the band (`alert_focus_requested` → `MapView.focus_and_select_tile`), then
  pins the exact band so ring/Tile card/roster/panel all agree.
- **Bands vs expeditions.** `update_band_alerts` splits the player faction into
  `_player_bands` (resident bands — NOT `is_expedition`) and `_player_expeditions`
  (detached scout/hunt parties). The cycler + band-picker read `_player_bands`
  only, so a band + 2 expeditions reads **1/1**, not 1/3. Expeditions surface
  instead as an **Active expeditions** section on their home band (see below).
- **Active expeditions section.** `_render_band_into_panel` → `_build_panel_expeditions_block`
  builds a self-contained expeditions **section block** (handed to the panel in the section
  array, so it's its own flow item / stack row) with one ghost-button
  row per `_player_expeditions` entry whose `home_band_entity == _panel_band.entity`
  (correct for N bands; omitted when none). Row summary — mission glyph + subject + the sim
  `ExpeditionPhase` as a **glyph** (`FoodIcons.for_status`), the phase WORD having moved into the row
  tooltip: hunt `🏹 <herd> · <Policy>  ●`, scout `⚑ → (x,y)  ➤`. The tooltip spells out the mission,
  the hunt policy's behaviour hint, the phase + what it means, and the click affordance.
  **`awaiting` is the one exception — it keeps its words, WARN-amber** (`▮▮ Awaiting orders`): it is
  not a status but a demand on the player (the party is parked at its objective burning provisions
  until you act), and a call to action must never require a hover to find. (A follow-up will make
  `awaiting` a turn-orb attention producer; the orb model already fits it.)
  A row click reuses the cycler's routing —
  `alert_focus_requested`→`focus_and_select_tile` + `roster_occupant_selected`→
  `MapView.select_occupant` — so the map ring moves to the expedition and the
  **Occupants card** (not the band panel) renders its `_build_expedition_panel`
  drawer; `_panel_band` stays put. `home_band_entity` is decoded in
  `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` from the snapshot's `homeBandEntity`,
  flowed onto the MapView unit marker, and covered by `marker_field_guard`.
- **Responsive body — section blocks (tall stack vs wide column-flow).** The band
  content is a list of discrete **section blocks** Hud hands the panel via
  **`set_band_sections(blocks: Array)`** (replacing the old
  `get_band_alloc_container()`/`get_band_detail_label()`/`get_band_expeditions_container()`
  fill-a-container contract): the summary RichTextLabel block, the Active-expeditions
  block, then the allocation sections (Workers / Current actions / Band roles / Orders /
  Send expedition). Hud builds them in `_render_band_into_panel` (allocation sections from
  `_build_allocation_sections` — the per-row stepper/band-picker/pending/expedition wiring
  is unchanged, only each row's *parent* is its section VBox now; the legacy flat
  `%AllocationPanel` fallback still fills by appending the same blocks). The panel **owns**
  the blocks (frees the prior set on each call) and arranges them by dock aspect
  (`_relayout_body`/`_arrange_sections`, hooked off `_apply_dock_layout`, reparenting the
  **same** block nodes on a tall↔wide flip — no Hud re-render): **tall** (LEFT/RIGHT) = a
  vertical `ScrollContainer` stack whose reserved **WIDTH fits the content** (`_measure_tall_width`,
  the mirror of the wide height fit): the cross-axis width is `maxf(PANEL_WIDTH, content-min)` (the
  PanelContainer's combined min width — margins + widest section), floored at `PANEL_WIDTH`, so
  `_root`, the seam (`_position_seam`), and the reservation all track the **true card edge** — a wide
  section (a long Hunt row, the send-expedition button) no longer overflows a fixed-380 `_root` and
  freezes the seam mid-card. Re-measured (deferred one frame, `is_equal_approx`-guarded — the content
  min is width-independent so there's no resize feedback) on `set_band_sections`, dock/collapse change,
  and viewport resize. **Wide** (TOP/BOTTOM) = **manual balanced-column packing** (`_pack_wide_columns`):
  column count from the
  available width (`num_cols = clamp(avail / (_widest_block_width() + WIDE_FLOW_SEPARATION), 1,
  #blocks)` — the budget is `max(SECTION_COLUMN_WIDTH, widest section's own min width)`, NOT the
  nominal column width: a section wider than nominal (a Current-actions row now carries a resource
  glyph + label + policy tag + yield + ⚠ + the stepper) grows its column, and budgeting off the
  nominal width summed the columns past the window — the last one clipped behind a horizontal
  scrollbar), blocks distributed **greedily into the shortest column** so the tallest column
  is minimized, columns in an HBox. The panel then **sizes its T/B height to the content** —
  the reservation it reports (`reservation_changed`) is `header + tallest-column + margins`,
  so the map/HUD reflow to exactly fit and **nothing clips** (fit-to-content, not a fixed
  `PANEL_HEIGHT`). Re-packs on dock change, `set_band_sections` (content change), and window
  `size_changed`; a deferred re-measure (`await process_frame`) lets the `fit_content` summary
  RichTextLabel settle before the height is finalized. Safety net: reserved height is capped
  at `MAX_WIDE_HEIGHT_FRACTION` of the window, past which the columns' ScrollContainer
  re-enables vertical scroll. (Earlier `VFlowContainer` / fixed-height wide layouts were
  replaced — VFlowContainer can't do fit-to-content *and* multi-column: unbounded height
  stops it wrapping.)
- Verify chrome + reflow via `tools/band_panel_preview.gd`
  (`godot --path . res://tools/band_panel_preview.tscn` → `ui_preview_out/
  band_panel_{left,right,top,bottom,collapsed}.png`). State `band_panel_status_glyphs` is the
  **row-vocabulary** frame: a confirmed working forage row (`●` + `♻` + the overstaffing note) and a
  working hunt row (`●` + `⚠`) beside a pending row (`○`, amber), plus one Active-expeditions row per
  phase (`➤` outbound / `●` hunting / `◄` delivering / `◄` returning / `▮▮ Awaiting orders` in amber)
  — read it at true size whenever a glyph changes.

**Capability gating** (`Inspector._apply_capability_gating`): most tabs enable only when the matching `CapabilityFlags` bit is set. **Terrain is exempt** — it is an always-available inspection tab with no capability-gated actions (the former Found Camp action + its CAP_CONSTRUCTION gate were removed with the retired `found_camp` command). **Migrated tab panels don't grey out** — instead of disabling the tab (confusing: a dead tab with no explanation), the coordinator calls `panel.set_available(has_flag)` and the panel stays clickable, rendering a "🔒 Locked — unlocks via …" message while gated (see `PowerPanel`). `_set_tab_enabled` is still used for tabs not yet migrated to the panel contract. Its **terrain-type highlight** dropdown lists every defined terrain (via `TerrainDefinitions`), and selecting one calls `MapView.set_terrain_highlight(id)`, which outlines/tints all matching hexes map-wide (ignoring Fog of War) — handy for spotting a biome or confirming one is absent. Selecting "none" (`-1`) clears it.

The overview text draws a **full biome histogram** (`_render_terrain` → `_histogram_bar`): every present biome, sorted by count, with a monospace `[code]` bar scaled to the most common biome plus its tile count and percentage — all computed client-side from the streamed `_terrain_counts`. The **Export Map** button (`_on_export_map_button_pressed`) sends the fire-and-forget `export_map` runtime command; the server writes the current map (terrain snapshot + resolved seed) to its `exports/` scratch dir as JSON (see `sim_schema` `MapExport`). Tile coordinates shown here as `@x,y` (`_format_tile_coords`) index straight into the export's row-major samples, so the same coordinate names a hex in the client, in the export file, and in tests.

### Tab-panel extraction pattern

`Inspector.gd` is being decomposed from a single god-object into per-tab panels;
`Inspector` stays the **coordinator** (streaming, capability gating, typography,
reserved-width/resize) and forwards each update to the tab panels. A tab panel:

- Is a script attached to the tab's own scene node (its `class_name` typed by the
  node's base type — the Power tab is a `ScrollContainer`, so `PowerInspectorPanel
  extends ScrollContainer`). References its widgets by `%UniqueName` (mark those
  nodes `unique_name_in_owner` in `InspectorLayer.tscn`) and wires its own signals
  in `_ready()`. Same model as the pre-existing `scripting/ScriptManagerPanel`.
- Implements the coordinator contract: `apply_update(data: Dictionary,
  full_snapshot: bool)` — the panel reads only the snapshot/delta keys it owns and
  re-renders itself — and `reset()` — drop all panel state so the coordinator can
  re-seed it from a clean slate. `Inspector._apply_update` forwards to
  `panel.apply_update(...)`; `_render_static_sections` calls `panel.reset()` (today
  only on init; it is the hook a future disconnect/full-reinit flow would call). The panel owns its schema keys,
  state, and rendering; the coordinator knows none of them. Panels needing extra
  collaborators add setters (as `ScriptManagerPanel` does with `set_manager()`).
- Capability-gated panels also implement `set_available(available: bool)` — the
  coordinator maps the `CapabilityFlags` bit to it in `_apply_capability_gating`,
  and the panel renders a locked explanation while unavailable (the tab is *not*
  disabled). Always-on tabs (e.g. Terrain) skip this.

Optional contract hooks a panel adds only if it needs them:
- `apply_typography()` — the coordinator's `apply_typography()` calls it so the
  panel styles its own widgets (`CrisisPanel`). `Typography.gd` is currently a
  no-op stub, so this has no visual effect yet — it preserves intent for when
  typography is implemented.
- Collaborator setters for cross-cutting dependencies, kept narrow: `set_map_view`
  (overlay sync), `set_command_hooks(send: Callable, append_log: Callable)` for
  tabs that issue runtime commands (`CrisisPanel` spawn/auto-seed, `KnowledgePanel`
  policy/budget/mission). The panel never reaches back into the coordinator — it
  holds only the Callables/handles it is given.
- `set_command_connected(connected: bool)` — for tabs whose command controls
  enable/disable on the command socket state (`KnowledgePanel`). The coordinator's
  `_update_command_controls_enabled` delegates the panel's own controls to this.
- `ingest_log_entry(entry: Dictionary)` — for tabs fed by parsed *log messages*
  rather than snapshot keys (`KnowledgePanel` knowledge/espionage/counter-intel
  telemetry). The coordinator's log loop calls it per entry.
- Public feeder methods for cross-panel data flow (`KnowledgePanel.append_events`,
  fed by Trade's diffusion records). The two panels never reference each other —
  `TradePanel` emits `knowledge_events_produced(records)` and the coordinator
  forwards the batch to `KnowledgePanel.append_events` (wired in `_ready`).
- Coordinator-owned state pushed into a display panel: `SentimentPanel.set_axis_bias`
  — axis bias belongs to the Commands axis controls (which mutate it optimistically),
  so the coordinator pushes it to the Sentiment view at both the snapshot and the
  optimistic-write sites, instead of the panel owning the key.
- Command-issuing via a signal when the command needs coordinator-only context (pattern
  reference; the Fauna/Terrain examples were retired with the single-task commands — FaunaPanel
  is now display-only and TerrainPanel's Scout button is gone). `set_log_hook(append_log)` is the
  log-only variant of `set_command_hooks` (`VictoryPanel`'s one-shot victory announcement).

The coordinator collects extracted panels in `_tab_panels` and fans `apply_update`
out to them at the **end** of `_apply_update`, after its own key routing (e.g.
`_ingest_overlays`), so a panel's own keys win over coordinator-side feeders on
conflict (see the `crisis_overlay` vs `overlays.crisis_annotations` precedence note).

**Reference implementations:** `ui/inspector/PowerPanel.gd` (Power — pure
snapshot/render), `ui/inspector/CrisisPanel.gd` (Crisis — command hooks +
typography), `ui/inspector/KnowledgePanel.gd` (Knowledge — the fullest: connection
gating, log-path ingestion, and the Trade→Knowledge event feed), and
`ui/inspector/TradePanel.gd` (Trade — map-overlay collaborator + the emit side of
the Knowledge↔Trade seam). **The decomposition is complete** — every inspector tab is
now its own panel (see the key-scripts table). `Inspector.gd` (≈880 lines, down from
~6,500) is purely the coordinator: streaming fan-out, the command hub + autoplay timer,
capability gating, typography, MapView attach, and the cross-panel seams (faction
resolution for Fauna/Terrain, influencer resonance → Culture, the `overlays` fan-out
junction routing palette→Terrain / annotations→Crisis / channels→Overlay).

**Commands tab (designer/debug console).** The `Commands` tab (axis-bias, heat,
config-reload, autoplay row, influencer/corruption command
buttons, command status/log; the scenario scout/follow rows were removed with the retired
single-task commands) is now `CommandsPanel` (see the key-scripts table). Its
subtree once went missing in the 2025-11-21 scene split (`Main.tscn` → instanced
`InspectorLayer.tscn`) and sat dead for months — the coordinator's
`get_node_or_null("RootPanel/TabContainer/Commands/…")` refs silently resolved to
`null` — before it was transplanted back from git history and extracted onto the
tab-panel contract. The **command hub stays in the coordinator**: `_send_command` →
`command_client`, `_ensure_command_connection`, the `autoplay_timer`, and turn-sending
are shared with the turn controls in `RootPanel/CommandToolbar` (outside the
`TabContainer`) and the Terrain tab's Export Map button. The panel issues
verbs through `set_command_hooks` and is connection-gated via `set_command_connected`.
Autoplay is split: the toggle+interval widgets live in the panel (relayed as
`autoplay_toggled`/`autoplay_interval_changed`), while the timer that steps turns and
the toolbar Play/Pause mirroring stay in the coordinator (which calls back
`set_autoplay_active`). Axis bias is coordinator-owned (Sentiment depends on it): the
panel emits `axis_bias_apply_requested` and the coordinator sends + mirrors it back via
`set_axis_bias`. The influencer dropdown is fed `InfluencerPanel.get_influencers()`
through the coordinator (`set_influencer_roster`).

## Overlay Channels

Raster overlays streamed from `core_sim`:

| Channel | Color | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `logistics` | Blue | Throughput flow |
| `sentiment` | Red | Morale/agency composite |
| `corruption` | Amber | Ledger intensity + risk weights |
| `fog` | Slate | Inverted knowledge coverage |
| `culture` | Violet | Divergence magnitude |
| `military` | Green | Readiness scalar |
| `terrain_tags` | Blended | Per-tag colors averaged |
| `pasture` | Straw→grass ramp, **+ two off-ramp barren tones** | The GRAZE layer's per-tile **capacity** (`TileState.grazeCapacity`) |
| `forage` | Wheat→green ramp, **+ one off-ramp barren tone** | The FORAGE (human food) layer's per-tile **capacity** (`TileState.forageCapacity`) |

Legend rendering: min/avg/max values + channel description.

**`pasture` — the graze (pasture) layer, Grazing Phase 2a** (`docs/plan_grazing_foundation.md`;
`core_sim/CLAUDE.md` → The Graze (Pasture) Layer). Graze is the **animal-edible** vegetal stock
(grass and browse — cellulose humans cannot digest), the twin of the **human-edible** `ForagePatch`
biomass, and it sits on nearly every land tile with its own per-biome distribution. Four things about
this channel are load-bearing:
- **It is NOT a wire raster.** Graze rides `TileState` (per-entity diffed → zero delta bytes on an
  ungrazed turn), so the channel is **assembled in the native decoder from the tiles**
  (`snapshot_dict`'s `OverlaySlices.pasture_capacity`), exactly as the logistics fallback already is.
  Everything downstream — MapView's channel ingest, the OverlayPanel selector, the legend — then works
  with no special-casing. (Do **not** synthesize it client-side in MapView the way `province` is: a
  MapView-only channel never reaches OverlayPanel's selector, so it can't be picked.)
- **It paints CAPACITY, not fill.** "How good a pasture is this ground?" is the question the layer
  exists to answer (is prairie really pasture; is forest really poor?) and it is a property of the
  biome. The *fill* (`biomass / capacity` — "how eaten-down is it?") is a different question: it rides
  the legend as a map-wide standing-stock %, and per-tile on the tile card. It earns its own ramp only
  once herds actually eat graze (Phase 2b).
- **Zero pasture is NOT low pasture, and the ramp must never say it is.** A desert at 8/8 (full, but
  marginal) and a glacier that carries no pasture at all are completely different facts — and a naive
  `biomass/capacity` ratio renders BOTH as 100%. So capacity 0 leaves the ramp entirely:
  `MapView._pasture_color` paints **water** (Water terrain tag — server truth, not the render-side
  `blend_class`) a drowned slate and **dead land** a bare rock-violet, while any positive capacity
  starts at `PASTURE_POOR_COLOR` straw. The normalization is against the map's **richest** pasture, not
  min-max (min-max would rebase the ramp onto the worst *land* value and make a marginal desert read
  like a dead glacier).
- **Its legend is its own** (`_build_pasture_legend`, not `_build_scalar_overlay_legend`): the generic
  builder reports min/avg/max over EVERY tile, and here the map-wide min is 0 (the sea), which would
  report the world's poorest pasture as "0". Rows: Poorest / Average / Richest **over the tiles that
  actually carry pasture**, then `Barren ground` + `Water` counts. Keep row labels short — the legend
  panel clips.

Verify with `map_preview` state **"pasture"** (`map_pasture.png` — an earthlike-shaped map; it also
prints the legend dict, since that harness has no HUD) and `ui_preview` `pasture_legend` /
`tile_pasture_stressed` / `tile_pasture_none` (+ `food_tile`, which carries both stocks). **The live
earthlike map generates zero forest** (the biome palette thins `MixedWoodland`/`BorealTaiga` out
entirely — tracked in `core_sim/CLAUDE.md`), so the forest-is-poor-pasture inversion the two-stock
split exists to create is **unobservable in a live frame**; `map_preview`'s fixture stages a woodland
block deliberately so it can be seen at all.

**`forage` — the human-food layer, the twin of `pasture`** (`docs/plan_grazing_foundation.md` §1.1;
`core_sim/CLAUDE.md` → The two food webs). Forage is the **human-edible** potential of a tile — seeds,
nuts, tubers, fruit and inshore fish — from `forage.capacity_by_biome` (`labor_config.json`), the
mirror table of graze's. It is a **per-tile POTENTIAL on every tile**, exactly like pasture (NOT the
sparse per-`ForagePatch` stock), sourced from a new per-tile `TileState.forageCapacity`. Built the SAME
way as pasture — assembled in the native decoder (`OverlaySlices.forage_capacity`, from
`tile.forageCapacity()` in the tiles loop), normalized against the map's **richest** forage tile, and
cached client-side in `MapView.tile_forage` (from `tile_to_dict`'s `forage_capacity`, only tiles > 0)
for the legend's Poorest/Average/Richest figures. **THE ONE THING THAT DIFFERS FROM PASTURE:** "no
forage" and "no pasture" mean **opposite** things, and the render must not lie about it —
- **Water is NOT uniformly barren.** ContinentalShelf (130) / CoralShelf (180) / InlandSea (110) carry
  real fishing potential and sit **ON the ramp**, so coastal shelves **glow** on the forage map where
  they are dead water on the pasture map — the signature divergence of the two food webs. Only
  genuinely-zero biomes (DeepOcean, Glacier, lava, salt flat) leave the ramp.
- **There is NO "land but no site" middle category and NO Water off-row.** `MapView._forage_color` is a
  straight twin of `_pasture_color` minus the water/dead split: `normalized > 0` → the wheat→green ramp
  (`FORAGE_POOR_COLOR`→`FORAGE_RICH_COLOR`, a distinct green from pasture's so the two layers read
  apart); `normalized <= 0` → the single `FORAGE_BARREN_COLOR` slate. (A dark forage tile can be
  perfectly good FARMLAND — the barren fill is only the genuinely-zero biomes.)
- **Its legend is its own** (`_build_forage_legend`): Poorest/Average/Richest over the tiles that carry
  forage, then **one** honest `No forage` barren row (no Water row — shelves are on the ramp). The
  description carries a **`Gathering sites: N tiles`** sub-count (from `MapView.food_sites`, the tiles
  you can actually forage today — a subset of the potential), so the ramp reads as POTENTIAL without
  calling the rest of the land dead.

Verify with `map_preview` state **"forage"** (`map_forage.png`, same earthlike fixture as `map_pasture`
so the two compare tile-for-tile — forest/river valleys read RICH on forage where prairie/steppe reads
richest on pasture, and the shelf column glows on forage where it is barren on pasture; it prints the
legend dict) and `ui_preview` `forage_legend` (the honest twin — `No forage` barren row, no Water row,
the gathering-sites sub-count). The forage `capacity_by_biome` table ships in the sim, so the live
inversion is real; the fixture stages it deterministically for the harness.

## Typography & Theming

Shared `Theme` resource reads `INSPECTOR_FONT_SIZE`, applies to root `CanvasLayer`. Typography map: `body`, `heading`, `caption`, `legend`, `control`.

Helper: `Typography.gd` provides offset deltas (heading = base + 4, caption = base − 2).
