## Key Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Main.gd` | Scene orchestration, streaming toggle |
| `MapView.gd` | Terrain rendering, overlays, hex selection, navigation (WASD/QE/mouse), 2D minimap |
| `Inspector.gd` | Inspector coordinator: streaming fan-out, capability gating, typography; hosts per-tab panels |
| `ui/inspector/PowerPanel.gd` | Power tab panel — reference for the tab-panel extraction contract (`apply_update`/`reset`) |
| `ui/inspector/CrisisPanel.gd` | Crisis tab panel — adds command hooks (`set_command_hooks`) and `apply_typography` to the contract |
| `ui/inspector/KnowledgePanel.gd` | Knowledge tab panel — adds `set_command_connected` (connection-gating), `ingest_log_entry` (log-path telemetry), and `append_events` (Trade→Knowledge feed) |
| `ui/inspector/TradePanel.gd` | Trade tab panel — `set_map_view` (overlay), owns the Map-tab overlay toggle, and emits `knowledge_events_produced` (the coordinator forwards it to KnowledgePanel — panels stay decoupled) |
| `ui/inspector/SentimentPanel.gd` | Sentiment tab panel — display; axis bias is coordinator-owned and pushed in via `set_axis_bias` |
| `ui/inspector/VictoryPanel.gd` | Victory tab panel — display + one-shot "victory achieved" log via `set_log_hook` |
| `ui/inspector/FaunaPanel.gd` | Fauna tab panel — **display-only** herd list/detail + estimated hunt yields. The follow-herd command it used to emit was retired with the single-task fauna commands (Early-Game Labor slice 3a; hunting is now HUD labor allocation), so it issues no command; `set_command_connected` is a contract no-op |
| `ui/inspector/GreatDiscoveriesPanel.gd` | GreatDiscoveries tab panel — large, self-contained (ledger + progress + definition catalog + details); capability-gated (`CAP_MEGAPROJECTS`), no command/log/MapView coupling |
| `ui/inspector/LogsPanel.gd` | Logs tab panel — owns the LogStreamClient + polling + filters + tick sparkline; emits `log_entry_received` (coordinator dispatches to Knowledge/Trade); fed synthetic lines via `append_entry` |
| `ui/inspector/InfluencerPanel.gd` | Influencers tab panel — owns the influencer roster; capability-gated (`CAP_INDUSTRY_T1`/`T2`) via `set_available`; exposes `aggregate_resonance()` (coordinator feeds it into the Culture tab) and `get_influencers()` (coordinator's still-inline influencer command controls read the roster back). The influencer *command* controls stay coordinator-owned |
| `ui/inspector/CorruptionPanel.gd` | Corruption tab panel — display-only ledger (reputation modifier, audit capacity, incidents); not capability-gated |
| `ui/inspector/CommandsPanel.gd` | Commands tab panel — the designer/debug console (axis-bias, influencer/channel/spawn, corruption inject, heat, config reload, autoplay row, command status/log; the scenario scout/follow rows were removed with the retired single-task commands). Outbound: issues verbs via `set_command_hooks` and logs via the sink; the command transport + autoplay timer + turn-sending stay in the coordinator. Couplings are coordinator-mediated: emits `axis_bias_apply_requested` (coordinator owns `_axis_bias`, pushes back via `set_axis_bias`), `autoplay_toggled`/`autoplay_interval_changed` (coordinator drives the timer, mirrors via `set_autoplay_active`); fed the roster via `set_influencer_roster` and gated via `set_command_connected`. NOT in `_tab_panels` (no snapshot inputs) |
| `ui/inspector/OverlayPanel.gd` | "Map Overlays" section (nested inside the Map tab, attached to `OverlaySection`) — owns the overlay-channel selector (built at runtime), channel metadata, and the culture/military readouts; drives `MapView.set_overlay_channel`. Fed via `set_map_view` + `ingest(overlay_dict, terrain_tag_labels)` (the coordinator re-homes the palette → Terrain and crisis_annotations → Crisis side-routes that share the `overlays` key, and passes Terrain's tag labels since the terrain-tags channel depends on them). NOT in `_tab_panels` |
| `ui/inspector/MapPanel.gd` | Map tab panel — map-size controls, start-profile (scenario) controls, and the hydrology rivers toggle. Snapshot-driven (in `_tab_panels`): `apply_update` consumes `grid`/`campaign_profiles`/`campaign_label`/`faction_inventory`. Issues `map_size`/`start_profile` via `set_command_hooks`, gated by `set_command_connected`, and drives `MapView.set_highlight_rivers` via `set_map_view`. The nested Map-Overlays section keeps its own `OverlayPanel` script |
| `ui/inspector/CulturePanel.gd` | Culture tab panel — culture layers, divergence list + detail, tension readout; drives `MapView.set_culture_layer_highlight`. Snapshot-driven (in `_tab_panels`): `apply_update` ingests `culture_layers`/`culture_layer_updates`/`culture_layer_removed`/`culture_tensions`, but rendering is driven by the coordinator via `render(resonance)` — the influencer-resonance "pushes" line is coordinator-mediated (`InfluencerPanel.aggregate_resonance()` passed in). `set_map_view` (highlight) + `set_log_hook` (new tensions log to the Logs feed) |
| `ui/inspector/TerrainPanel.gd` | Terrain tab panel — the largest: biome list + drill-down, tile list/detail, the runtime terrain-highlight dropdown, and the **Export Map** button (the tile Scout button was retired with the single-task `scout` command). Snapshot-driven (in `_tab_panels`): `apply_update` ingests `tiles`/`tile_updates`/`tile_removed`/`food_modules` and renders. Owns the inbound MapView hex-selection (`focus_tile_from_map`, coordinator forwards) and drives `set_terrain_highlight` / `relative_height_at` via `set_map_view`. The biome palette + tag labels arrive on the `overlays` key (coordinator routes them in via `set_terrain_palette`/`set_terrain_tag_labels`; `get_terrain_tag_labels()` feeds OverlayPanel). Export sends via `set_command_hooks`, gated by `set_command_connected` |
| `Hud.gd` | HUD layer, legend, the split **Tile card** (`TilePanel`/`%TileDetail` — terrain + the `%ForageAssignControls` "assign foragers" stepper) + **Occupants roster card** (`OccupantsPanel`/`%RosterList`/`%OccupantDetail` — selectable bands+wildlife roster with a per-occupant detail drawer; a player band shows the `%AllocationPanel` labor-allocation UI, a herd the `%HerdAssignControls` "assign hunters" stepper+policy picker), band **Alerts** panel, turn readout. Both cards + all selection state (`_selected_tile_info`/`_selected_unit`/`_selected_herd`) + the snapshot-captured `_player_band` live here; roster selection emits `roster_occupant_selected`; labor edits emit `assign_labor_requested` / `move_band_requested` / `cancel_order_requested` (clear-all) |
| `ui/BandFoodStatus.gd` | Single source of truth for band food-supply thresholds (`band_status_config.json`) + the days→green/amber/red color / BBCode-hex mapping (plus the parallel morale warn/critical thresholds + `color_for_morale`/`hex_for_morale`), shared by MapView's band dot and Hud's food/morale lines + alerts |
| `ui/TileHabitability.gd` | Single source of truth for the Tile-card Habitability rating: buckets `TileState.habitability` (band-independent per-turn morale drain) into Hospitable/Fair/Harsh/Hostile via `tile_habitability_config.json` thresholds, with the HEALTHY/INK/WARN/DANGER color / `hex_for_rating` mapping. Consumed by `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` + `_format_detail_bbcode` |
| `ui/TileClimate.gd` | Single source of truth for the Tile-card Climate band: maps `TileState.temperature` (°, a latitude+elevation climate, equator-in-the-middle) into Tropical/Warm/Temperate/Cool/Polar via `tile_climate_config.json` cutoffs. INFORMATIONAL only — deliberately no HEALTHY/WARN/DANGER tint (renders neutral ink), so it doesn't compete with the Habitability row's semantic palette. Consumed by `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` |
| `SnapshotStream.gd` | Consumes length-prefixed FlatBuffers snapshots |
| `CommandBridge.gd` | Issues Protobuf commands to server |
| `ui/MinimapPanel.gd` | Minimap component for the 2D map view (click-to-pan, aspect ratio sizing) |
| `ui/AutoSizingPanel.gd` | Shared helper for panels that expand to fit content |
| `ui/HudStyle.gd` | Single source of truth for the dark HUD console look: palette (cyan `SIGNAL`, amber `WARN`, ink/line neutrals), `card_stylebox()`, `header_stylebox()`, `banner_stylebox()`, and `apply_button(btn, "primary"/"ghost"/"armed")`. Every HUD surface styles through here |
| `ui/FoodIcons.gd` | Shared map-marker emoji glyphs — food modules (`for_site`) and fauna herds (`for_herd`, species keyword matched in the herd label, longest-first). Covers migratory species plus wild game (deer/boar/rabbit/fowl). Used by the Harvest/Hunt button (`Hud.gd`) and the map's food-site / herd markers (`MapView._draw_food_site` / `_draw_herd`) so a source always reads the same |
| `tools/ui_preview.gd` / `.tscn` | Dev-only preview harness: instances the real `HudLayer` with canned selection/targeting data, renders each state, and saves PNGs to `ui_preview_out/` (gitignored). Iterate on HUD styling without a server: `godot --path . res://tools/ui_preview.tscn` |
| `tools/map_preview.gd` / `.tscn` | Dev-only **MapView** preview harness (HUD-only ui_preview's companion): instances the real `MapView`, feeds a canned `display_snapshot` + selects a band, and dumps PNGs (`map_*.png`) to `ui_preview_out/`. Verifies the selected-band labor highlights (work-range ring / worked forage tiles / hunted-herd ring+link / scouted radius) without a server: `godot --path . res://tools/map_preview.tscn` |
| `assets/terrain/TerrainTextureManager.gd` | Autoload singleton for terrain texture loading |
| `assets/terrain/TerrainDefinitions.gd` | Single source of truth for terrain definitions |

## Architecture

### Scene Structure
- `Main.tscn` - Root `Node2D` scene with a `Camera2D`, the `MapView` map layer, and `CanvasLayer`s for HUD/inspector
- The client is **2D-only**; an experimental 3D relief view was permanently removed (see `docs/architecture.md` → "Removed: 3D Relief Rendering")
- Toggle: `I` hides/shows inspector, `L` collapses legend

### Data Flow
```
Server (FlatBuffers) -> SnapshotStream.gd -> parsed snapshot
                                          -> MapView (terrain/overlays)
                                          -> Inspector (panels)
                                          -> Hud (legend, selection)
```

### Native Extension
`native/` contains GDExtension bindings for FlatBuffers decoding (generated from `sim_schema/schemas/snapshot.fbs`).

> **Note:** Elevation is not rendered as 3D relief. A shallow-3D heightfield view was
> prototyped and permanently removed; elevation is surfaced as the 2D **Elevation
> Heatmap** overlay and as a per-tile **Height** readout in the tile panels (the HUD
> selection panel via `MapView._tile_info_at` → `Hud._tile_summary_lines`, and the
> Inspector Terrain tab). All read the same normalized `ElevationOverlay.samples` raster —
> there is no per-tile elevation on `TileState`. **Height is a relative 0..100 indicator**
> (a number + filled/empty bar), NOT meters: it exists so a player can reason about line of
> sight — a higher tile can occlude the tile behind it (matching the LOS raycast in
> `visibility_systems.rs`). `MapView.relative_height_at` rescales the above-sea-level span
> into 0..100 (at/below sea level reads 0, since open water occludes nothing). The sea level
> is the **active map's** `sea_level`, streamed per-snapshot as `ElevationOverlay.seaLevel`
> (pre-normalized server-side to the raster's [min,max] scale) and read into
> `MapView._elevation_sea_level` — no hardcode; `HEIGHT_DEFAULT_SEA_LEVEL` is only the
> pre-first-snapshot fallback. `MapView.format_height` is the single source of truth for the
> number+bar formatting. The
> raster still streams from the core for the heatmap and for gameplay (LOS), but the
> per-vertex `normals` field (3D-only) was dropped from the schema. See
> `docs/architecture.md` → "Removed: 3D Relief Rendering".

## Minimap System

The map view displays a minimap in the bottom-right corner showing the full map with a viewport indicator rectangle.

### Component (`ui/MinimapPanel.gd`)
Reusable minimap UI component handling:
- CanvasLayer hierarchy setup (layer 102)
- Aspect ratio sizing from grid dimensions
- Click-to-pan with drag support
- Viewport indicator overlay with draw callbacks

### 2D Minimap (MapView.gd)
- Renders terrain at 1 pixel per hex as an `ImageTexture`
- Viewport indicator uses pointy-top hex coordinate math:
  - Screen corners → axial coords (q,r) → offset coords (col,row) → normalized [0,1]
- Click-to-pan converts normalized position → hex grid coords → pan_offset

### Configuration
Minimap sizing parameters live in `heightfield_config.json` (the file also holds fog-of-war appearance tunables; its 3D-relief sections were removed):
```json
"minimap": {
  "base_height": 220,
  "min_width": 140.0,
  "max_width": 520.0,
  "margin": 16.0
}
```

## Terrain Texture System

Optional terrain texture graphics for the 2D map view.

### Asset Structure
```
assets/terrain/
  textures/
    base/                        # 37 terrain textures (512x512 PNG)
      00_deep_ocean.png
      ...
      36_aquifer_ceiling.png
    edges/                       # 6 edge masks for blending (optional)
    wang/                        # Wang tile variants (future)
  terrain_config.json            # Configuration
  TerrainTextureManager.gd       # Autoload singleton for centralized texture loading
  TerrainDefinitions.gd          # Single source of truth for terrain definitions
  TerrainTextureGenerator.gd     # CLI script to generate placeholder textures
```

### Enabling Terrain Textures
1. Generate placeholder textures from command line:
   ```bash
   godot --headless --path clients/godot_thin_client --script assets/terrain/TerrainTextureGenerator.gd
   ```
2. Replace placeholders in `assets/terrain/textures/base/` with AI-generated or hand-crafted textures
3. Set `"use_terrain_textures": true` in `terrain_config.json`

Textures are loaded at runtime from individual PNGs and combined into a `Texture2DArray`.

### Configuration (`terrain_config.json`)
```json
{
  "use_terrain_textures": true,
  "use_edge_blending": true,
  "texture_scale": 4.0,
  "blend_width": 0.15,
  "lod_near_distance": 50.0,
  "lod_far_distance": 200.0
}
```

### Texture Loading (TerrainTextureManager)
- Autoload singleton loads textures once at startup for the 2D map renderer
- Builds `Texture2DArray` from individual PNGs in `textures/base/`
- Exposes: `terrain_textures` (Texture2DArray), `terrain_config`, `use_terrain_textures`, `use_edge_blending`

### 2D Rendering Pipeline
- `MapView` gets textures from `TerrainTextureManager` and pre-renders hex-masked textures on startup
- Cached as `ImageTexture` per terrain ID for efficient drawing
- Falls back to solid colors when overlay mode is active
- Textures only displayed in base view (empty overlay key)
- Fog of War keeps textures: the draw loop classifies each tile once via
  `_visibility_state_at()` — Active tiles draw full-brightness, Discovered tiles
  are tinted toward the mist color (cloudy) via `_fow_texture_tint_for_state()`,
  Unexplored tiles fill with the fog color.
- Runtime toggle: `T` key (`enable_terrain_textures` / `_toggle_terrain_textures`)
- Edge blending: gradient lines drawn at terrain boundaries

### Edge Blending - Overlay/Fringe Technique
When `use_edge_blending` is enabled, the 2D renderer uses a standard overlay/fringe technique:
- 6 edge gradient masks (`assets/terrain/textures/edges/edge_mask_*.png`)
- 222 pre-rendered edge overlays (37 terrains × 6 edges)
- Neighbor terrain texture fades in at hex boundaries

Generate edge masks: `godot --headless --script assets/terrain/EdgeMaskGenerator.gd`

---

## HUD Panel Framework (Docked PanelCards)

The HUD (`HudLayer.tscn`) owns the screen regions with one layout authority — a
`RootColumn` VBox split into `TopBar` / `ContentRow(LeftDock · center · RightDock)`
/ `BottomBar`. No panel positions itself with absolute offsets into a region;
everything is container-sized so regions never collide.

### Inspector as a reserved side dock
The `Inspector` is a debug/telemetry CanvasLayer docked (resizable) against the
**left** edge. It does not overlap or rearrange gameplay panels — instead it
*reserves* space, shrinking the game area to fit beside it, as if the window were
narrower:

- `Inspector.reserved_width()` reports the strip it occupies (`_panel_width +
  2·PANEL_MARGIN`, or 0 when hidden) and emits `reserved_width_changed` on
  show/hide and on live drag-resize.
- `Main._on_inspector_reserved_width_changed` fans that width out to both
  surfaces: `Hud.set_left_inset(px)` (insets `LayoutRoot.offset_left`, so every
  bar and dock lives in the narrower rect) and `MapView.set_view_inset_left(px)`.
- `MapView.set_view_inset_left` makes the map behave as if the window were that
  much narrower, via three coordinated pieces:
  1. `_get_adjusted_viewport_size()` subtracts the inset, so fit, pan-clamp, draw
     extents, hit-testing and the minimap indicator all treat the remaining width
     as the whole viewport.
  2. The node is translated right by the same amount (`position.x = inset`) so
     that reduced coordinate space renders beside the panel. Because
     `get_local_mouse_position()` accounts for the node transform, clicks stay
     correct without touching any screen↔hex math.
  3. `_apply_view_clip()` (in `_draw`, via `RenderingServer.canvas_item_set_clip`)
     clips every draw command to the usable rect. This is essential: the map is
     **cover-fit**, so its content is wider than the reduced viewport and would
     otherwise overflow left into the reserved strip. Clipping confines it.

Because the HUD, Inspector, and map all sit under the same `content_scale`
transform, the reserved width is a single canvas-space value that applies to all
three with no per-surface scaling. Panels keep their natural left/right docks.

### PanelCard (`ui/PanelCard.gd`)
The single building block for every dock panel. It is a `PanelContainer` (never a
bare `Panel`) that owns the chrome — styled background + title header — and hosts
caller content in a plain `VBoxContainer`. Because it is container-sized, it
always reports a correct minimum size, so the dock reflows automatically.

- **Content contract:** author one child `VBoxContainer` named `CardContent`. The
  card inserts its title header as that container's first row and **never
  reparents the authored widgets** — reparenting them into a runtime wrapper
  silently clears `unique_name_in_owner`, so `%Name` references from the owner
  script break. Reference inner widgets by unique name (`%Name`).
- **Rule:** no anchor-positioned children inside a card. Anchor layout inside a
  container parent is what made the legacy `Panel`s overlap.
- API: `card_title` / `set_card_title()`, `get_content()`, and `hotkey_hint`
  (renders the toggle key in the header, e.g. `"Terrain Types (L)"`; leave empty
  for panels with no show/hide hotkey).
- Replaces the bespoke `ui/AutoSizingPanel.gd` height math — the dock's own
  `ScrollContainer` owns overflow, so cards only size to content.

### PanelDock (`ui/PanelDock.gd`)
Ordered controller for one dock region's `VBoxContainer`. Panels `add(panel,
priority)` to register; the dock reparents them in priority order. Visibility is
data-driven — `set_relevant(panel, false)` (or `panel.visible = false`) removes a
panel from layout flow and the stack reflows with no gap. Hud builds `left_dock`
and `right_dock` in `_ready()`.

**Scroll behaviour:** on construction the dock disables **horizontal** scrolling
on its enclosing `ScrollContainer` and zeroes the stack's horizontal minimum, so
the stack always fills the dock width and content wraps to fit rather than
spilling under a sideways scrollbar (which reads as unpolished for a game HUD).
**Vertical** scroll mode is *not* set by PanelDock — it is configured per dock in
the scene (`HudLayer.tscn`); both docks use `AUTO`, so a scrollbar appears only
when the stack actually overflows.

**Migration status:** `TilePanel`, `OccupantsPanel` (the split selection cards),
`CommandFeedPanel`, and
`TerrainLegendPanel` are now `PanelCard`s (the last two dropped the bespoke
`AutoSizingPanel` height math and the legend's absolute `PRESET_TOP_RIGHT`
positioning that used to overlap the Victory panel). `StockpilePanel` and
`VictoryPanel` are still plain `PanelContainer`s (correctly container-sized, but
not yet cards). `AutoSizingPanel.gd` remains only for the Inspector.

---

## Command Targeting

Labor allocation is source-centric (assign workers to a source/role, see the **Labor
allocation UI** bullet below). The one remaining **targeting mode** is **move-band** —
picking a destination tile — replacing the old easy-to-miss "select a band…" line.

- **Selection split — Tile card + Occupants roster** (`Hud.gd`): the old single
  selection panel is now **two left-dock `PanelCard`s driven by one script**. The
  **Tile card** (`TilePanel`/`%TileDetail`, priority 10) is the *place* — terrain
  rows (Biome/Height/Tags + the gather module relabeled `Forage:`) and, on a
  food-module tile, the `%ForageAssignControls` "assign foragers" stepper. The
  **Occupants card** (`OccupantsPanel`, priority 12,
  hidden via the dock on an empty hex) is a **selectable roster** of the bands +
  wildlife on the hex, built at runtime into `%RosterList` as two sub-groups
  (`Bands (N)` / `Wildlife (N)`); each row is a `Button` hosting a mouse-transparent
  HBox — a selection accent, a **vitality dot**, name, size, and (bands) an
  activity glyph. Below the roster, `%OccupantDetail` is the selected occupant's
  **detail drawer** (player band → `_unit_summary_lines` + `%AllocationPanel`; herd →
  `_herd_summary_lines` + `%HerdAssignControls`). Selecting a row (`_on_roster_row_selected`) re-homes the
  selection and emits `roster_occupant_selected(kind, id)`; **Main forwards it to
  `MapView.select_occupant`, which moves the map selection ring** (sets
  `selected_unit_id`/`selected_herd_id`) with no hex click. A fresh tile click
  auto-selects the first occupant through the same path. The **vitality dot is
  unified** across map/roster/drawer: a band's dot uses `BandFoodStatus.color_for_days`
  (`days_of_food` → green/amber/red), a herd's uses `_ecology_tier_color`
  (`ecology_phase` → thriving green / stressed amber / collapsing red), sharing the
  exact `HudStyle` HEALTHY/WARN/DANGER constants. Non-player bands list with a neutral
  dot and no allocation panel (their larder/orders aren't ours to see). (The Tile card
  has no camp action — the `found_camp` command was removed end-to-end.)
- **Labor allocation UI** (`Hud.gd`, Early-Game Labor slice 3b — `docs/plan_early_game_labor.md`):
  the band is a **labor pool** whose working-age workers are assigned source-centrically to
  in-range sources/roles. There is **exactly one player band today**, captured each snapshot
  into `_player_band` (first player-faction cohort in `update_band_alerts`); assign/move/clear
  all target it. Three runtime-built control sets replace the retired single-task Scout/Cancel,
  Hunt/policy, and Forage buttons:
  - **`%AllocationPanel`** (band drawer, player band only, `_build_allocation_panel`): reads as a
    "current actions" report — a `Working: N   Idle: M` header, a **Current actions** section with one
    `−/+` **worker-stepper** row per staffed Forage tile / Hunt herd (from the cohort's
    `labor_assignments`; an empty-state hint when none), then a **Band roles** section with the
    always-shown **Scout** + **Warrior** rows (even at 0), each with a one-line hint so the `−/+`
    steppers read as "this is how you staff this standing role" (Scout's hint shows the live
    `scout_reveal_radius`; there is no targeted scout map-action anymore). Then **Move** / **Clear all**.
    Each stepper re-sends `assign_labor_requested` with the new count (0 removes); `+` is gated on
    `idle_workers > 0`.
  - **Selected-band map highlights** (`MapView._draw_band_work_highlights`, drawn when a player band
    is selected, cleared on deselect): the **worked forage tiles** (strong green fill on each
    `forage` assignment's `target_x/y`), the **work-range ring** (thin cyan outline on every tile
    within `work_range`, replicating the sim's **Chebyshev** `max(|dx|,|dy|) <= work_range` on integer
    offset coords — truthful-over-pretty, so highlighted == actually-assignable), the **scouted radius**
    (faint blue shading over the reveal disc when a scout is staffed — a **Euclidean** `dx²+dy² <= r²`
    disc, matching the sim's `clear_circle` fog reveal, deliberately a different metric from the
    work-range square), and the **hunted herds** (red ring on the herd tile + a band→herd link, drawn
    wherever the herd is since hunt reach = `work_range` + leash). New snapshot fields `work_range` /
    `scout_reveal_radius` are decoded in `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` and flowed onto the
    MapView unit marker in `_rebuild_unit_markers` (alongside `labor_assignments`).
  - **`%HerdAssignControls`** (herd drawer, huntable herds, `_build_herd_assign_controls`): an
    "Assign hunters" **compose** control — a Hunters `−/+` count (`_hunt_assign_count`), a
    sustain/surplus/market/eradicate **policy picker** (`_build_policy_picker`, `_hunt_assign_policy`,
    `LABOR_HUNT_POLICIES`, default `sustain`), and an **Assign** button → `assign_labor hunt <herd_id>
    <policy> <workers>`. Compose state re-seeds from current staffing when the selected herd changes.
  - **`%ForageAssignControls`** (Tile card, food-module tiles, `_build_forage_assign_controls`): an
    "Assign foragers" Foragers `−/+` count (`_forage_assign_count`) + **Assign** → `assign_labor
    forage <x> <y> <workers>`.

  All emit `assign_labor_requested(payload)` (payload: `faction/band/kind/workers/x/y/herd_id/policy`);
  `Main._on_hud_assign_labor` formats the `assign_labor …` text command. **Clear all** emits
  `cancel_order_requested` (the repurposed `cancel_order` = clear-all → fully idle). The roster
  glyph / map activity ring keep reading the still-populated `activity` (now the largest-worker
  kind: `idle|forage|hunt|scout|warrior`) and `hunt_mode`. `harvestTask`/`scoutTask` are always
  null server-side and no longer decoded. **Convenience shortcut:** double-clicking a herd on the
  map (`MapView.herd_quick_hunt_requested` → `Main._on_map_herd_quick_hunt` → `Hud.quick_assign_hunters`)
  assigns the player band's idle workers to hunt that herd at Sustain — a no-op with a command-feed
  note when there are no idle workers (never silently nothing).
- **Herd ecology readout** (`Hud.gd` `_herd_summary_lines`): the selection panel shows
  the group's `ecology_phase` (snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.ecologyPhase`) as an
  **Ecology** row — a neutral "Thriving", or a warned "⚠ Stressed" / "⚠ Collapsing"
  that `_format_detail_bbcode` tints amber / red (`_ecology_value_hex`, `HudStyle.WARN_HEX`
  / `DANGER_HEX`). A `Collapsing` herd has been overhunted past the point of no return and
  is crashing to local extinction (see `core_sim` Fauna & Wild Game — depensation collapse).
- **Clear-all / move-band** (`Hud.gd`, Early-Game Labor slice 3b): the single-task
  Scout/Cancel affordance + its optimistic `_pending_transition_bands` machinery were
  **retired** with the labor-allocation model. There is no longer a band-global task to
  cancel — you staff a source down to 0 (`assign_labor … 0`). The **Clear all** button on
  `%AllocationPanel` emits `cancel_order_requested`; `Main._on_hud_cancel_order` sends the
  **repurposed** `cancel_order <faction> <band_bits>` (now clears ALL assignments → fully
  idle). **Move band** is the one remaining targeting flow: the panel's **Move** button
  (`_on_move_band_pressed`) enters tile-targeting (`_pending_move_band` → `_current_targeting_info`
  returns `command: "move", need: "tile"`), the top-centre banner reads "MOVE … click a
  destination tile", and the destination click (`_try_dispatch_pending_move_band`, via
  `show_tile_selection` / `notify_hex_selected`) emits `move_band_requested(payload)` →
  `Main._on_hud_move_band` → `move_band <faction> <band> <x> <y>`. Esc/right-click cancel
  via `cancel_active_targeting` → `_cancel_pending_move_band`.
- **Herd husbandry readout** (`Hud.gd` `_herd_summary_lines`): when a herd's
  `domestication` (snapshot `HerdTelemetryState.domestication`, 0–1) is above 0, a
  **Husbandry** row shows "Domesticating N%" while it's being tamed and "🐄 Domesticated"
  (SIGNAL tint via `_husbandry_value_hex`) once fully domesticated. Progress builds while a
  band Sustain-follows a Thriving herd; the `domesticate` command claims it early (see
  `core_sim` Fauna & Wild Game — Domestication / husbandry).
- **Sedentarization meter** (`Hud.gd` `update_sedentarization`, dispatched from `Main.gd`):
  the player faction's `SedentarizationState.score` (snapshot `sedentarization[]`) shows as a
  compact top-bar block-glyph meter (`▰▰▰▰▰▱▱ 62/100 · soft`, `SedentarizationLabel` in
  `TurnBlock`), tinted amber (soft) / cyan (hard) by stage and hidden until the score is
  meaningful. The soft/hard threshold prompts themselves arrive in the command feed
  (`CommandEventKind::SedentarizationPrompt`). See `core_sim` Campaign Loop — Sedentarization.
- **Demographics readout** (`Hud.gd` `update_demographics`, dispatched from `Main.gd`): the player
  faction's age structure from `PopulationDemographicsState` (snapshot `demographics[]`) shows as a
  top-bar line (`Pop 100  👶34 🛠51 🧓15  dep 96/100`, `DemographicsLabel` in `TurnBlock`) — total
  head-count, the three brackets, and the **dependency ratio** `(children+elders)/working` per 100
  workers, tinted amber when dependents outnumber workers / cyan on a healthy labor surplus. Hidden
  until the faction has population. See `core_sim` Campaign Loop — Population & Demographics.
- **Band food status** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.daysOfFood` / `activity` / `supplyNetworkId` /
  `stores[]`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs` `population_to_dict` as `days_of_food` / `activity` /
  `supply_network_id` / `stores{item:qty}`): the green/amber/red warn·critical thresholds and the
  day→color mapping live in one place, `ui/BandFoodStatus.gd` (config `src/config/band_status_config.json`,
  key `food_days.{warn,critical}`; `999` = not food-limited → ∞). Surfaced three ways:
  (1) `MapView._draw_band_status` draws a food-days dot + a per-`activity` ring on each **player** band
  (`_is_player_unit`; idle bands draw no ring); (2) `Hud._band_food_line` adds a `Food  <N>  (<D> days)`
  row to the band selection panel, tinted by the thresholds via `_format_detail_bbcode`;
  (3) `MapView._draw_supply_links` faint-chains player bands sharing a `supply_network_id` (`0` = solo).
- **Band morale readout** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.morale`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
  `population_to_dict` as `morale`, a 0–1 float on each cohort dict; flowed into the MapView unit marker
  in `_rebuild_unit_markers`): a band can shrink while well-fed when a harsh tile erodes morale until
  births fall below elder mortality. `BandFoodStatus.gd` owns the morale thresholds too (config key
  `morale.{warn,critical}` = `0.40`/`0.25`, just above the ~0.20 birth floor) and the mirrored
  `color_for_morale`/`hex_for_morale` helpers (same green/amber/red palette, but a plain scalar — no
  "unlimited" sentinel). `Hud._band_morale_line` adds a `Morale: <N>%` row to the drawer **for player
  bands only** (`_is_player_unit`), tinted by `hex_for_morale` via `_format_detail_bbcode` (same
  stash-then-tint pattern as the Food row, using `_selected_band_morale`).
- **Morale trend + named cause** (snapshot `PopulationCohortState.moraleDelta` / `moraleCause`, decoded in
  `native/src/lib.rs` `population_to_dict` as `morale_delta` (raw Scalar/1e6, signed) / `morale_cause`
  (int; `0=None,1=Terrain,2=Cold,3=Unrest`), flowed into the MapView unit marker): "low morale" named the
  symptom, not the cause — the morale drivers live server-side and were discarded each turn until the
  cohort started exporting the per-turn trend + dominant negative driver. `Hud._band_morale_line` appends
  a trend arrow (`▼` falling / `▲` rising / none when `|morale_delta| < MORALE_TREND_EPSILON`) and, when
  falling, the plain-language cause via `_morale_cause_label` — `Terrain`→"harsh terrain", `Cold`→"harsh
  climate" (the server penalty fires on hot **or** cold deviation, so not literally "cold"),
  `Unrest`→"unrest". `Terrain` appends the band's `_selected_tile_info.terrain_label` in parens
  (`Morale: 22% ▼ — harsh terrain (Karst Cavern Mouth)`) — the "it's the hex you're on" payload. A
  rehydrated save reports `morale_delta 0 / cause None` for one turn (the sim doesn't persist them); the
  row degrades to a bare percentage.
- **Civilization Wellbeing — productivity, itemized morale, recovery** (see
  `docs/plan_civ_wellbeing.md`; snapshot `PopulationCohortState.outputMultiplier` /
  `discontentFraction` / `lastEmigrated` / `lastImmigrated` / `grievance` + the four signed
  Layer-1 contributions `moraleSettling` / `moraleTerrain` / `moraleClimate` / `moraleUnrest`,
  decoded in `native/src/lib.rs population_to_dict` as `output_multiplier` / `discontent_fraction`
  / `last_emigrated` / `last_immigrated` / `grievance` (telemetry only, not displayed in P1) /
  `morale_settling` / `morale_terrain` / `morale_climate` / `morale_unrest`, all flowed onto the
  MapView unit marker in `_rebuild_unit_markers`). Player-band drawer only (`_unit_summary_lines`):
  - **Output row** (`_band_output_line`): `Output: N%` shown when `output_multiplier < OUTPUT_FULL`
    (1.0), placed just under Morale. Tinted ink → amber → red by `BandFoodStatus.hex_for_output`
    (config `band_status_config.json` `output.{warn,critical}` = `0.85`/`0.60`; near-full reads
    neutral ink, *not* green — it's a productivity note, not a "good"). Ties productivity to morale.
  - **Itemized morale breakdown** (`_morale_breakdown_lines`): the four signed contributions
    (their sum IS `morale_delta`) as indented sub-lines (e.g. `    ▲ +1.0%  settling`), shown when
    morale is concerning (`_morale_is_concerning`: below warn **or** falling past
    `MORALE_TREND_EPSILON`). Only contributions above `BandFoodStatus.morale_breakdown_epsilon()`
    (config `morale.breakdown_epsilon` = `0.002`) list. Labels: `settling`,
    `harsh terrain (<terrain_label>)` (matches the headline cause treatment), `harsh climate`, and
    `unrest`/`culture` by sign. `_format_detail_bbcode` tints each row two-tone by its sign glyph
    (▲ = HEALTHY green, ▼ = WARN amber — deliberately not a rainbow); the indented breakdown lines
    are intercepted before the KV split.
  - **Recovery guidance** (`RECOVERY_GUIDANCE_TEXT`): a dim `↑ Recover: move to Hospitable ground ·
    Scout · Hunt` line (the real levers, NOT harvest), appended under the breakdown.
    `_split_detail_kv` skips lines beginning with `↑` so it renders as a dim sentence, not a KV row.
  - **Action morale hints**: the Scout button tooltip (`MORALE_HINT_SCOUT`, "(+morale)") and the four
    persistent Hunt/Follow policy tooltips (Sustain/Surplus/Market/Eradicate get `MORALE_HINT_PERSISTENT`
    appended, "(+morale/turn)") advertise the positive levers; the one-shot Single policy does not.
- **Tile-card Habitability** (snapshot `TileState.habitability`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
  `tile_to_dict` as `habitability` (raw Scalar/1e6; band-independent per-turn morale drain of the tile's
  terrain + temperature, ≥0, bigger = harsher), stored in `MapView.tile_habitability` keyed by
  `Vector2i` and copied onto the `_tile_info_at` dict): `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` adds a
  `Habitability: <rating>` row (before the FoW discovered/unexplored returns — it's terrain-intrinsic, so
  fine on a remembered tile; only shown when the field is present). `ui/TileHabitability.gd` is the single
  source of truth — config `src/config/tile_habitability_config.json` (`habitability.{hospitable_max,
  fair_max,harsh_max}` = `0.02`/`0.05`/`0.09`) buckets the drain into Hospitable/Fair/Harsh/Hostile,
  tinted HEALTHY/INK/WARN/DANGER via `hex_for_rating` in `_format_detail_bbcode` (mirrors the
  `BandFoodStatus` bucketing pattern). The Karst Cavern Mouth (~0.0825) reads "Harsh" (amber).
  With the latitude climate + cold-morale tolerance dead-band (see `core_sim`), temperate
  mid-latitudes read "Hospitable", the equator "Hospitable/Fair", and poles/high-alt/caverns
  "Harsh/Hostile" — the config buckets (`0.02`/`0.05`/`0.09`) spread cleanly across that range,
  so no re-tune was needed.
- **Tile-card Climate** (snapshot `TileState.temperature`, decoded in `native/src/lib.rs`
  `tile_to_dict` as `temperature` (°); temperature is now a **latitude + elevation** climate
  (equator-in-the-middle, poles cold) with a small element jitter, NOT the old element
  checkerboard — see `core_sim`), stored in `MapView.tile_temperature` keyed by `Vector2i` and
  copied onto the `_tile_info_at` dict): `Hud._tile_terrain_lines` adds a `Climate: <band>` row
  next to Habitability (before the FoW discovered/unexplored returns — it's terrain-intrinsic, so
  fine on a remembered tile; only shown when the field is present so rehydrated tiles degrade
  gracefully). `ui/TileClimate.gd` is the single source of truth — config
  `src/config/tile_climate_config.json` (`climate.{tropical_min,warm_min,temperate_min,cool_min}`
  = `26`/`20`/`12`/`3`) maps the temperature into Tropical/Warm/Temperate/Cool/Polar, making the
  latitude gradient legible ("far south → Polar"). The row is **informational** — neutral ink, no
  HEALTHY/WARN/DANGER tint, so it doesn't overload the Habitability row's warning semantics.
- **Alerts panel** (`Hud.gd` `update_band_alerts`, dispatched from `Main.gd` on the snapshot
  `populations`): a left-dock `PanelCard` (`AlertsPanel`/`%AlertsLabel`, priority 15) that rebuilds each
  snapshot from the player faction's bands — **starving** (`days_of_food` < critical, red),
  **losing population** (`size` dropped vs the previous snapshot, tracked in `_prev_band_sizes`, amber),
  and **idle** (`activity == idle`, quiet dim). The losing-population alert names its cause via
  `_decline_reason(days, morale, morale_cause, last_emigrated)`: `days < critical` → `— starving`
  (first), then `last_emigrated > 0` → `— people leaving` (morale no longer kills — discontent
  relocates people; see `docs/plan_civ_wellbeing.md`), else the dominant `morale_cause` maps to the
  same plain-language labels as the drawer (`— harsh terrain` / `— harsh climate` / `— unrest`),
  falling back to `— low morale` when the cause is `None` (e.g. a rehydrated save). Alerts are
  (band, type) deduped by construction and clear
  when resolved; each row is a `[url=x,y]` link whose `meta_clicked` emits `alert_focus_requested(x,y)` →
  `MapView.focus_on_tile` (shared minimap centering machinery). Hidden via the dock until an alert exists.
  NOTE: cohorts carry no top-level band label in the snapshot — names fall back to a positional
  "Band N"; a server-side band-label field would make names authoritative.
- **Targeting is now move-band only** (`Hud.gd`): the single-task forage/scout/hunt/follow
  `_pending_*` flows were retired with labor allocation. `_current_targeting_info()` returns a
  descriptor (`{active, command: "move", need: "tile", origin_x/y, context_label}`) only while
  `_pending_move_band` is set; `_refresh_targeting()` shows the floating **targeting banner**
  (top-centre, `HudStyle.banner_stylebox()`: cyan reticle + command + "click a destination tile"
  + Cancel) and emits `targeting_changed(info)`.
- **Main forwards** `hud.targeting_changed → map_view.set_targeting` and
  `map_view.targeting_cancel_requested → hud.cancel_active_targeting`.
- **MapView draws** the overlay (`_draw_targeting`): `need == "tile"` draws a reticle on the
  hovered hex (the `need == "band"` path is now unused). Esc / right-click during targeting emit
  `targeting_cancel_requested` instead of panning; the pulse is animated from `_process`.
- **Resolution**: the destination tile click (`_try_dispatch_pending_move_band`) emits
  `move_band_requested` → `Main._on_hud_move_band` → `move_band …`.
- **Retired verbs (Early-Game Labor slice 3a):** the server now parses-but-ignores
  `follow_herd` / `scout` / `forage` / `hunt_fauna` / `hunt_game`. Every client control that
  emitted them was removed or repointed so nothing is silently dead: the map double-click
  `scout` shortcut was dropped and `follow` repointed to quick-assign hunters; Main's
  `_issue_*`/`_on_hud_follow_herd`/`_on_hud_unit_scout` builders are gone; the Fauna tab's
  follow button, the Terrain tab's Scout Tile button, and the Commands tab's scenario
  Scout/Follow rows were removed (script + `InspectorLayer.tscn` nodes). No code path in
  `Main.gd`/`Hud.gd`/`MapView.gd`/`Inspector.gd` builds any of those five lines.

## Inspector Panels

See `docs/godot_inspector_plan.md` for full roadmap.

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Map | Overlay selector, logistics toggle, map size dropdown, Generate Map button |
| Terrain | Full biome histogram, tag histograms, tile drill-down, terrain-type highlight dropdown, **Export Map** button |
| Fauna | Herd registry + density telemetry (display-only; follow-herd command retired) |
| Culture | Layer trait vectors, divergence meters, resonance pushes |
| Military | Readiness heatmaps, cohort summaries |
| Power | Grid metrics, node list, incident feed |
| Crisis | Dashboard gauges, modifier tray, event log |
| Knowledge | Ledger overview, timeline graph, espionage mission queue |
| Logs | Streaming tracing feed, level/target/text filters, duration sparkline |
| Commands | Turn/rollback/autoplay, axis bias, spawn utilities, debug hooks |

**Capability gating** (`Inspector._apply_capability_gating`): most tabs enable only when the matching `CapabilityFlags` bit is set. **Terrain is exempt** — it is an always-available inspection tab with no capability-gated actions (the former Found Camp action + its CAP_CONSTRUCTION gate were removed with the retired `found_camp` command). **Migrated tab panels don't grey out** — instead of disabling the tab (confusing: a dead tab with no explanation), the coordinator calls `panel.set_available(has_flag)` and the panel stays clickable, rendering a "🔒 Locked — unlocks via …" message while gated (see `PowerPanel`). `_set_tab_enabled` is still used for tabs not yet migrated to the panel contract. Its **terrain-type highlight** dropdown lists every defined terrain (via `TerrainDefinitions`), and selecting one calls `MapView.set_terrain_highlight(id)`, which outlines/tints all matching hexes map-wide (ignoring Fog of War) — handy for spotting a biome or confirming one is absent. Selecting "none" (`-1`) clears it.

The overview text draws a **full biome histogram** (`_render_terrain` → `_histogram_bar`): every present biome, sorted by count, with a monospace `[code]` bar scaled to the most common biome plus its tile count and percentage — all computed client-side from the streamed `_terrain_counts`. The **Export Map** button (`_on_export_map_button_pressed`) sends the fire-and-forget `export_map` runtime command; the server writes the current map (terrain snapshot + resolved seed) to its `exports/` scratch dir as JSON (see `sim_schema` `MapExport`). Tile coordinates shown here as `@x,y` (`_format_tile_coords`) index straight into the export's row-major samples, so the same coordinate names a hex in the client, in the export file, and in tests.

### Tab-panel extraction pattern

`Inspector.gd` is being decomposed from a single god-object into per-tab panels;
`Inspector` stays the **coordinator** (streaming, capability gating, typography,
reserved-width/resize) and forwards each update to the tab panels. A tab panel:

- Is a script attached to the tab's own scene node (its `class_name` typed by the
  node's base type — the Power tab is a `ScrollContainer`, so `PowerInspectorPanel
  extends ScrollContainer`). References its widgets by `%UniqueName` (mark those
  nodes `unique_name_in_owner` in `InspectorLayer.tscn`) and wires its own signals
  in `_ready()`. Same model as the pre-existing `scripting/ScriptManagerPanel`.
- Implements the coordinator contract: `apply_update(data: Dictionary,
  full_snapshot: bool)` — the panel reads only the snapshot/delta keys it owns and
  re-renders itself — and `reset()` — drop all panel state so the coordinator can
  re-seed it from a clean slate. `Inspector._apply_update` forwards to
  `panel.apply_update(...)`; `_render_static_sections` calls `panel.reset()` (today
  only on init; it is the hook a future disconnect/full-reinit flow would call). The panel owns its schema keys,
  state, and rendering; the coordinator knows none of them. Panels needing extra
  collaborators add setters (as `ScriptManagerPanel` does with `set_manager()`).
- Capability-gated panels also implement `set_available(available: bool)` — the
  coordinator maps the `CapabilityFlags` bit to it in `_apply_capability_gating`,
  and the panel renders a locked explanation while unavailable (the tab is *not*
  disabled). Always-on tabs (e.g. Terrain) skip this.

Optional contract hooks a panel adds only if it needs them:
- `apply_typography()` — the coordinator's `apply_typography()` calls it so the
  panel styles its own widgets (`CrisisPanel`). `Typography.gd` is currently a
  no-op stub, so this has no visual effect yet — it preserves intent for when
  typography is implemented.
- Collaborator setters for cross-cutting dependencies, kept narrow: `set_map_view`
  (overlay sync), `set_command_hooks(send: Callable, append_log: Callable)` for
  tabs that issue runtime commands (`CrisisPanel` spawn/auto-seed, `KnowledgePanel`
  policy/budget/mission). The panel never reaches back into the coordinator — it
  holds only the Callables/handles it is given.
- `set_command_connected(connected: bool)` — for tabs whose command controls
  enable/disable on the command socket state (`KnowledgePanel`). The coordinator's
  `_update_command_controls_enabled` delegates the panel's own controls to this.
- `ingest_log_entry(entry: Dictionary)` — for tabs fed by parsed *log messages*
  rather than snapshot keys (`KnowledgePanel` knowledge/espionage/counter-intel
  telemetry). The coordinator's log loop calls it per entry.
- Public feeder methods for cross-panel data flow (`KnowledgePanel.append_events`,
  fed by Trade's diffusion records). The two panels never reference each other —
  `TradePanel` emits `knowledge_events_produced(records)` and the coordinator
  forwards the batch to `KnowledgePanel.append_events` (wired in `_ready`).
- Coordinator-owned state pushed into a display panel: `SentimentPanel.set_axis_bias`
  — axis bias belongs to the Commands axis controls (which mutate it optimistically),
  so the coordinator pushes it to the Sentiment view at both the snapshot and the
  optimistic-write sites, instead of the panel owning the key.
- Command-issuing via a signal when the command needs coordinator-only context:
  `FaunaPanel` emits `follow_herd_requested(herd_id)` (the follow command needs the
  active faction, which lives in the coordinator) rather than taking `set_command_hooks`;
  it also emits `herd_selected(herd_id)` so the coordinator can mirror the Commands
  follow field. `set_log_hook(append_log)` is the log-only variant of `set_command_hooks`
  (`VictoryPanel`'s one-shot victory announcement).

The coordinator collects extracted panels in `_tab_panels` and fans `apply_update`
out to them at the **end** of `_apply_update`, after its own key routing (e.g.
`_ingest_overlays`), so a panel's own keys win over coordinator-side feeders on
conflict (see the `crisis_overlay` vs `overlays.crisis_annotations` precedence note).

**Reference implementations:** `ui/inspector/PowerPanel.gd` (Power — pure
snapshot/render), `ui/inspector/CrisisPanel.gd` (Crisis — command hooks +
typography), `ui/inspector/KnowledgePanel.gd` (Knowledge — the fullest: connection
gating, log-path ingestion, and the Trade→Knowledge event feed), and
`ui/inspector/TradePanel.gd` (Trade — map-overlay collaborator + the emit side of
the Knowledge↔Trade seam). **The decomposition is complete** — every inspector tab is
now its own panel (see the key-scripts table). `Inspector.gd` (≈880 lines, down from
~6,500) is purely the coordinator: streaming fan-out, the command hub + autoplay timer,
capability gating, typography, MapView attach, and the cross-panel seams (faction
resolution for Fauna/Terrain, influencer resonance → Culture, the `overlays` fan-out
junction routing palette→Terrain / annotations→Crisis / channels→Overlay).

**Commands tab (designer/debug console).** The `Commands` tab (axis-bias, heat,
config-reload, scenario scout/follow, autoplay row, influencer/corruption command
buttons, command status/log) is now `CommandsPanel` (see the key-scripts table). Its
subtree once went missing in the 2025-11-21 scene split (`Main.tscn` → instanced
`InspectorLayer.tscn`) and sat dead for months — the coordinator's
`get_node_or_null("RootPanel/TabContainer/Commands/…")` refs silently resolved to
`null` — before it was transplanted back from git history and extracted onto the
tab-panel contract. The **command hub stays in the coordinator**: `_send_command` →
`command_client`, `_ensure_command_connection`, the `autoplay_timer`, and turn-sending
are shared with the turn controls in `RootPanel/CommandToolbar` (outside the
`TabContainer`) and the scout button in the Terrain tab. The panel issues
verbs through `set_command_hooks` and is connection-gated via `set_command_connected`.
Autoplay is split: the toggle+interval widgets live in the panel (relayed as
`autoplay_toggled`/`autoplay_interval_changed`), while the timer that steps turns and
the toolbar Play/Pause mirroring stay in the coordinator (which calls back
`set_autoplay_active`). Axis bias is coordinator-owned (Sentiment depends on it): the
panel emits `axis_bias_apply_requested` and the coordinator sends + mirrors it back via
`set_axis_bias`. The influencer dropdown is fed `InfluencerPanel.get_influencers()`
through the coordinator (`set_influencer_roster`).
