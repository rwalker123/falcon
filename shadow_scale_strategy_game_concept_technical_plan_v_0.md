## 1. Foundational Simulation Philosophy
- **Everything Emerges**: From atoms to societies, all systems are generated and interact procedurally.
- **No Hardcoding**: Units, technologies, materials, and even laws of physics differ each game.
- **Player as Discoverer**: Knowledge is earned through exploration and experimentation, not through pre-known trees.
- **Interlinked Systems**: Science, logistics, economy, and society feed into one another dynamically.
- **Replayability Through Uncertainty**: Each world’s discoveries, energy sources, and civilizations follow unique, unpredictable paths.

## 3. Dynamic Atomic & Material System
Each world begins with a **procedurally generated atomic chart**, redefining its chemistry and physics.

### Key Concepts:
- Elements have procedural traits: density, conductivity, magnetism, reactivity, isotopic stability.
- Unknown elements are discovered through experimentation and analysis.
- Materials and alloys emerge from combinations of elements—creating compounds with unique properties.
- Environmental context shapes the periodic table (planet pressure, temperature, radiation, gravity).

### Gameplay:
1. Mine unknown minerals → analyze via spectroscopy.
2. Classify discovered elements → expand the periodic chart.
3. Combine materials experimentally → generate alloys and energy sources.
4. Build technology chains using discovered compounds.

### Example:
| Element | Property | Usage |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Qr | High magnetic field density | Used in rail, armor, power grids |
| Ze | Reactive noble gas | Enables superconductive fuel cells |
| Xy | Corrosive but conductive metal | Short-term power conduits |

## 4. Energy & Power Systems
Energy emerges through experimentation, not predefined stages. Civilizations progress through discoveries that reframe their physical understanding of power.

### Energy Discovery Logic
- Energy is derived from **chemical, magnetic, gravitational, nuclear, or exotic** phenomena.
- Each energy form has benefits and drawbacks tied to material science and social structure.

### Examples:
- **Combustive Energy**: Simple, dirty, widely accessible.
- **Resonant Energy**: Harnessed via vibration of magnetic alloys.
- **Fusion Energy**: Requires isotopic refinement and containment mastery.
- **Quantum Lattice Energy**: Emergent property of high-order material interactions.

### Failures & Consequences:
- Energy instability → disasters, pollution, radiation.
- Resource depletion → societal collapse.
- Discovery of near-limitless energy → overpopulation and climate degradation.

## 5. Great Discovery System (GDS)
### Concept
Civilizations don’t evolve in eras—they leap. The **Great Discovery System** models emergent innovation that arises from interacting discoveries.

### Mechanism
- Each discovery updates global *Knowledge Fields* (physics, chemistry, biology, data, communication).
- When multiple related insights converge, a *Great Discovery Event* occurs.
- These events cause technological leaps, societal shifts, and geopolitical imbalance.

### Examples:
- **Atomic Resonance** → enables isotope refinement → leads to **Fusion Power**.
- **Neural Pattern Analysis** + **Quantum Storage** → **Synthetic Sentience**.
- **Subterranean Pressure Mapping** → **Antigravitic Flow Systems**.

### Leap Consequences
- Civilizations gain new industrial and military capabilities.
- Global power realignment; new hegemonies form.
- Discovery shock may collapse societies unprepared for change.

---

## 6. Logistics & Infrastructure System
Logistics drives civilization—supplies, fuel, and mobility determine victory.

### Core Systems
- **Transport Modes:** Ground, rail, hover, air, orbital—based on discovered materials.
- **Infrastructure Quality:** Road grade, rail type, energy dependency.
- **Throughput Simulation:** Flow determined by bottlenecks, maintenance, and weather.
- **Resource Specialization:** Trade hubs form around scarce isotopes or alloys.

### Integration with Materials & Energy
- New energy discoveries revolutionize logistics (e.g., hover-transport, tele-shipping).
- Fragile or unstable materials complicate long-range supply.
- Logistics AI dynamically reroutes based on terrain, infrastructure, and warfare.

## 7. Population & Societal Dynamics
Population represents the organic side of the simulation.

- **Growth:** Depends on food, infrastructure, and safety.
- **Decline:** Triggered by scarcity, disasters, or energy collapse.
- **Adaptation:** Genetic, cultural, or cybernetic evolution over time.
- **Migration:** Driven by climate, resource, or political change.

### Civilization Resilience
A strong logistics and energy base sustains population. Neglect or overexpansion triggers collapse cascades.

## 7a. Population Demographics & Workforce Simulation

Population is modeled as a dynamic set of age cohorts, each with distinct roles, needs, and impacts on civilization.

### Age Demographics
- **Infants/Children**: Dependent, education costs, future workforce.
- **Working Age**: Drives economic output, technology research, and military recruitment.
- **Older Generation**: Lower workforce participation, increased healthcare/social care costs, source of cultural continuity and expertise.

### Workforce Modeling
- **Labor Allocation**: Assignable to sectors (industry, agriculture, research, military, logistics).
- **Retirement & Aging**: Workforce shrinks as cohorts age out; policy and healthcare impact longevity.
- **Population Pyramid**: Shifts from expansion to contraction based on birth rates, longevity, and calamities.

### Reproduction & Growth Rates
- **Birth Rate**: Influenced by food security, social stability, cultural factors, and technology.
- **Death Rate**: Driven by disasters, resource scarcity, warfare, and healthcare access.
- **Generational Turnover**: Affects innovation speed, workforce renewal, and military recruitment pools.

### Societal Impacts
- **Aging Population**: Reduces available labor, increases dependency ratio; may trigger policy shifts (immigration, automation).
- **Youth Bulge**: Increases labor supply, potential for unrest or rapid expansion.
