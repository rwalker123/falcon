# Developer Ergonomics Survey (Week 2 Prototype)

Please complete after working with the Shadow-Scale prototype for a full workday.

1. **Setup Experience**
   - Time to build/run server & inspector?
   - Any missing prerequisites or unclear steps?

2. **Turn Workflow**
   - Was sending commands (`turn`, `heat`) intuitive?
   - Any tools/scripts you created manually that should ship in repo?

3. **Telemetry**
   - Were `RUST_LOG` outputs sufficient? What additional metrics/logs would help?

4. **Snapshot Consumption**
   - If you wrote a client, how easy was it to parse `WorldDelta`?
   - Feedback on FlatBuffers schema or binary framing?

5. **Benchmarks & Performance**
   - Did the Criterion harness answer scaling questions? What else do you need?

6. **Pain Points**
   - List the top 3 friction points you experienced.

7. **Wishlist**
   - Tools, docs, or automation you would prioritize next.

8. **Overall Satisfaction** (1â€“5)
   - 1 = very painful, 5 = delightful.

Optional: Attach logs, code snippets, or screenshots illustrating issues.
